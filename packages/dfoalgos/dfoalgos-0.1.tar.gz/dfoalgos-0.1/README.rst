dfoalgos has been tested with Python 2.7 and 3.4. The recommended version is
Python 3.x, because compatibility is reached by avoiding usage of xrange. So,
the code has a higher memory consumption under Python 2.

Everything in this package is pure Python. For a description of the contents
see DESCRIPTION.rst.
