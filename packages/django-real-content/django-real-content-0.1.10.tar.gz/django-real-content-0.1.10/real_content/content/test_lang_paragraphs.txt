The summit’s agenda includes a lengthy list of points of tension, including NATO enlargement, ballistic missile defence, positioning of NATO equipment and forces in Eastern European member states and NATO’s partnerships with states such as Georgia. At the same time, NATO is conducting a series of substantial military exercises in Eastern Europe, such as Anakonda-2016, the largest such exercises since the end of the Cold War. The Russian leadership has responded with a mix of vocal criticism threatening retaliatory measures, most notably President Putin’s statements that Romania would be targeted as a result
Law enforcement officers combed a 15-mile area around Ramah on Friday after cellphone records and a 3-year-old’s statement that “Mom’s in the lake” led authorities to believe they might find a missing school administrator in the swamps, forest and fields near the Atchafalaya Basin.

It was the fact when I first said it. It is the fact that I’m saying it now." Unfortunately for Hillary, the State Department today released an email from 2012 that totally contradicts her "fact." According to Catherine Herridge at Fox News, the email carries "a classified code known as a 'portion marking' - and that marking was on the email when it was sent
It's a country of around 185 million people, a member of OPEC and the biggest economy on its continent. But Nigeria may have more than it can handle with the "Niger Delta Avengers." Nigeria has vowed to rein in the militants who are relentlessly bombing the country's oil infrastructure and have slashed its crude output. But experts say the government of President Muhammadu Buhari lacks the military capacity and institutions to tackle the threat - and military action could make things much worse anyway. Little is certain about the motives of the Niger Delta Avengers. But the group claims through its website and Twitter feed that it wants a bigger share of the Niger Delta's resource wealth to go
