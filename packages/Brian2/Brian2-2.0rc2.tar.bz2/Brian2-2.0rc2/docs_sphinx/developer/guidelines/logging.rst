Logging
=======

Logging in Brian is based on the :mod:`logging` module in Python's standard
library. In Brian, all logging output is logged to a file (the file name is
available in `brian2.utils.logger.TMP_LOG`). This log file will normally be
deleted on exit, except if an uncaught exception occured or if
`logging.delete_log_on_exit` is set to ``False``. The default log level for the
logging on the console is "info".

Every brian module that needs logging should start with the following line,
using the `get_logger` function to get an instance of `BrianLogger`::

    logger = get_logger(__name__)

In the code, logging can then be done via::

    logger.diagnostic('A diagnostic message')
    logger.debug('A debug message')
    logger.info('An info message')
    logger.warn('A warning message')
    logger.error('An error message')

If a module logs similar messages in different places or if it might be useful
to be able to suppress a subset of messages in a module, add an additional
specifier to the logging command, specifying the class or function name, or
a method name including the class name (do not include the module name, it will
be automatically added as a prefix)::

    logger.debug('A debug message', 'CodeString')
    logger.debug('A debug message', 'NeuronGroup.update')
    logger.debug('A debug message', 'reinit')

If you want to log a message only once, e.g. in a function that is called
repeatedly, set the optional ``once`` keyword to ``True``::

    logger.debug('Will only be shown once', once=True)
    logger.debug('Will only be shown once', once=True)

The output of debugging looks like this in the log file::

    2012-10-02 14:41:41,484 DEBUG    brian2.equations.equations.CodeString: A debug message

and like this on the console (if the log level is set to "debug")::

    DEBUG    A debug message [brian2.equations.equations.CodeString]

Log level recommendations
-------------------------
diagnostic
    Low-level messages that are not of any interest to the normal user but
    useful for debugging Brian itself. A typical example is the source
    code generated by the code generation module.
debug
    Messages that are possibly helpful for debugging the user's code. For example,
    this shows which objects were included in the network, which clocks the
    network uses and when simulations start and stop.

info
    Messages which are not strictly necessary, but are potentially helpful for
    the user. In particular, this will show messages about the chosen state
    updater and other information that might help the user to achieve better
    performance and/or accuracy in the simulations (e.g. using ``(event-driven)``
    in synaptic equations, avoiding incompatible ``dt`` values between
    `TimedArray` and the `NeuronGroup` using it, ...)
warn
    Messages that alert the user to a potential mistake in the code, e.g. two
    possible solutions for an identifier in an equation. It can also be used to
    make the user aware that he/she is using an experimental feature, an
    unsupported compiler or similar. In this case, normally the ``once=True``
    option should be used to raise this warning only once. As a rule of thumb,
    "common" scripts like the examples provided in the examples folder should
    normally not lead to any warnings.
error
    This log level is not used currently in Brian, an exception should be
    raised instead. It might be useful in "meta-code", running scripts and
    catching any errors that occur.

The default log level shown to the user is ``info``. As a general rule, all
messages that the user sees in the default configuration (i.e., ``info`` and
``warn`` level) should be avoidable by simple changes in the user code, e.g.
the renaming of variables, explicitly specifying a state updater instead of
relying on the automatic system, adding ``(clock-driven)``/``(event-driven)``
to synaptic equations, etc.

Showing/hiding log messages
---------------------------
The user can change the level of displayed log messages by using a static
method of `BrianLogger`::

    BrianLogger.log_level_debug() # now also display debug messages

It is also possible to suppress messages for certain sub-hierarchies by using
`BrianLogger.suppress_hierarchy`::

    # Suppress code generation messages on the console
    BrianLogger.suppress_hierarchy('brian2.codegen')
    # Suppress preference messages even in the log file
    BrianLogger.suppress_hierarchy('brian2.core.preferences',
                                   filter_log_file=True)

Similarly, messages ending in a certain name can be suppressed with
`BrianLogger.suppress_name`::

    # Suppress resolution conflict warnings
    BrianLogger.suppress_name('resolution_conflict')

These functions should be used with care, as they suppresses messages
independent of the level, i.e. even warning and error messages.

Testing log messages
--------------------
It is possible to test whether code emits an expected log message using the
`~brian2.utils.logger.catch_logs` context manager. This is normally not
necessary for debug and info messages, but should be part of the unit tests
for warning messages (`~brian2.utils.logger.catch_logs` by default only catches
warning and error messages)::

    with catch_logs() as logs:
        # code that is expected to trigger a warning
        # ...
        assert len(logs) == 1
        # logs contains tuples of (log level, name, message)
        assert logs[0][0] == 'WARNING' and logs[0][1].endswith('warning_type')
