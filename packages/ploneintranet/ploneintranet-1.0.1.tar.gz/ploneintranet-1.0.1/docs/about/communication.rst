Quaive Board

Development Team
----------------

Community edition code lives on github, in the
`Plone Intranet organization <https://github.com/ploneintranet>`_

You're welcome to submit issues and pull requests there.

Active development and most issue tracking is done in a private repository, in the
`Quaive organization <https://github.com/ploneintranet>`_.

We use the #ploneintranet IRC channel on Freenode:
http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ploneintranet

The canonical place for documentation is http://docs.ploneintranet.org for the community
edition, and http://docs.quaive.net (requires login) for the enterprise edition.
