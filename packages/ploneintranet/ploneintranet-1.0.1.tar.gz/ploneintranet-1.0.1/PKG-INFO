Description: Plone Intranet
        ==============
        
        Plone Intranet is the community edition of the Quaive_ digital workplace
        and social intranet platform, built on top of
        Plone_ - the ultimate open source enterprise CMS.
        
        For more info about this product and how it is used, see our website
        at http://quaive.com
        
        Full community edition developer documentation is available at http://docs.ploneintranet.org/
        
        Please request a `free demo`_
        if you want to learn more about what our software can do.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Experienced Plone developers can set up the system by following the 
        `documented installation procedure`_.
        
        If you run into any issues, get in touch with the development team via
        the `developer mailing list`_.
        
        Note that this is an open source community edition release - you're expected
        to bring your own expertise and effort to complement ours.
        
        If you'd rather have a Quaive expert install and manage the system for you,
        contact one of our partners_ to contract support. This also gives you access
        to the enterprise edition, which has more features than the community edition.
        
        See our blog_ and our Twitter_ stream or Facebook_ page for the latest status.
