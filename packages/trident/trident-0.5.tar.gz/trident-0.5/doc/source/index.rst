Trident Documentation
=====================

Trident is a Python package for creating synthetic absorption-line spectra 
from astrophysical hydrodynamics simulations.  It utilizes the yt package
to read in simulation datasets and extends it to provide realistic 
synthetic observations appropriate for studies of the interstellar,
circumgalactic, and intergalactic media.
