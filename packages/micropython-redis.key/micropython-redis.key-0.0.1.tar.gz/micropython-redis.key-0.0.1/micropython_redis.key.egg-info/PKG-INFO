Description: This is a redis key module implemented specifically for MicroPython.
        
        As a result, this module does not support functionality not available on embedded environments and it is structured to allow operating in environments with limited resources.
        
        Note that this module is a work in progress and currently supports just a subset of all of the redis functionality
        
        Please help with the development if you are interested in this module.
