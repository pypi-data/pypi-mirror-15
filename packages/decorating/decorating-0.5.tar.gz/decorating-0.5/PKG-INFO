        Abstract
        ========
        
        This project was encouraging a explore the limits of decorators powers
        in Python, whose, however is not so knew for everyone (mainly the
        beginners), is a extremely useful feature of the language similar, whose
        can be similar of Lisp Macros, but without change the AST. The famous
        examples is the ``@animated`` and ``@writing`` decorator. BTW, because
        is fun too. All the repository is made from scratch, just using the
        Python ``stdlib``, no `dependency <requirements.txt>`__!
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        **INFO**: we need some people to do support for Python2, only Python3
        for now. Check #3
        
        **stable: last release**: ``sudo pip install decorating``
        
        **bleeding-edge**:
        ``sudo pip install git+https://www.github.com/ryukinix/decorating``
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Public decorators on the API of decorators ``decorating``:
        
        -  **debug**
        -  **cache**
        -  **counter**
        -  **count\_time**
        -  **animated**
        -  **writing**
        
        Examples
        ========
        
        Animated
        --------
        
        *Using as decorator and mixed with context-managers* |animation|
        
        Well
        
        *Using with nested context-managers* |context-manager|
        
        Writing
        -------
        
        Another project mine called `MAL <http://www.github.com/ryukinix/mal>`__
        whose is a basic command line interface for MyAnimeList, I recently test
        the features of @writing only adding 3 lines on my code! Check the
        awesome effect:

        Developers
        ^^^^^^^^^^
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            sudo git clone https://www.github.com/ryukinix/decorating
            cd decorating
            sudo make develop
        
        The develop mode creates a .egg-info (egg-link) as symlink with your
        standard ``site-packages``/``dist-packages`` directory. Don't be worry
        with the ``decorating.egg-info``, is only information for the package
        egg to link with your ``PYTHONPATH``. For that, the usage is dynamic,
        you can modify the code in test on the command line always using
        absolute imports in anywhere (like the first example)
        
        Contributing
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Avoid I blame you. You maybe don't will like that. I'm not Linus, but I
        can really do heavy critiques sometimes.[/lain ]. Although I'm joking,
        keep your life more easy, so setup the ``pre-commit`` after clone!
        
        In the root of git repository, do that commands:
        
        ::
        
            sudo pip install pre-commit pylint nose2
            pre-commit install
        
        If you don't know about pre-commit, check
        `pre-commit <http://pre-commit.com>`__ website.
        
        Now you can create a new branch ``git checkout -b feature`` based on the
        ``master`` (or other you wants improves, like ``dev``) and send a
        pull-request for me!
        
        If you just wants know something, I give a suggestion, create a new
        issue! I'll happy with it.
