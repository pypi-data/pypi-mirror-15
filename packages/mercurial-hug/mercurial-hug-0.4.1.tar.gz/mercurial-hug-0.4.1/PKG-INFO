        This library provides a wrapper around select Mercurial functionality. We aim for the wrapper to be
        friendlier to use than Mercurial itself (the libraries, that is, which are largely undocumented) and
        also to provide a stable API. To achieve this, we will implement *only* the functionality we need,
        and if you ask nicely we might also implement the functionality you need too.
        
        Also, Mercurial is licensed under the GPLv2+ and we use it under the terms of the GPLv3. This project
        is licensed according to the AGPLv3+, so if you're looking for a cushion from the strict copyleft
        license, this library is not your answer.
        
        Hosted on GitHub?!
        ------------------
        I know it's a little weird to host a project about Mercurial in a Git repository, but BitBucket is
        not impressive, and basically I didn't think it was worth off-GitHub hosting just for this small
        library. Sorry!
