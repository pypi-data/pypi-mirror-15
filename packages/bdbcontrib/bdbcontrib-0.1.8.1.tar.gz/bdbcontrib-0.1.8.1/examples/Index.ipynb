    "These example notebooks introduce probabilistic programming. We first look at applications, how generative models can be applied to populations in [BayesDB](http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/bayesdb/). We then progress towards creating new generative models that better fit our intuitions about those populations in [Venture](http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/venture). BayesDB and Venture are developed by the [MIT Probabilistic Computing Group](http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/). \n",
