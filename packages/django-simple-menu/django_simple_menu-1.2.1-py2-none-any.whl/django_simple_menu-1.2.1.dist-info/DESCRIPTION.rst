django-simple-menu is an entirely code based menu system, because, who really wants to define their
menus in the django admin...

It's simple to use, yet provides enough flexibility to provide unlimited children menus, per-request
generation and checking of menu items, badges, and more.


Quickstart
----------

Using django-simple-menu is easy.

Install ``django-simple-menu`` in your virtualenv and then add ``menu`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``.
Please ensure that you have ``django.core.context_processors.request`` listed in the
``TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS`` setting.

For each of your own apps that you want to expose a menu create a new file named ``menus.py`` and
define your menus using the ``Menu`` and ``MenuItem`` classes you can import from the ``menu``
namespace.

In a template you want to render a menu first ``{% load menu %}`` then call ``{% generate_menu %}``
inside a block and a new varaible named ``menus`` will be added to the context.  You can now iterate
over this ``menus`` object to render your menus.

To quickly see everything in action and evaluate django-simple-menut please check out the
`example project`_.
