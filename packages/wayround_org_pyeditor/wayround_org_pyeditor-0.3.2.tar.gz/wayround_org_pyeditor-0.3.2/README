I wanted editor to be fast. I wanted editor to do exactly what I
need. - PyEditor was born.

I want to make it lightweight, simple and extensible. Well.. maybe
from gi.introspection import Gtk is not so fast, but it's really works
fine.

Yep! I'm writing it with py3.4 and Gtk+3 PyGobject. It has some modes
support (for now only Python mode exists). And I'm planning some
plugin support, maybe for git repositories.

GitHub is currently the main publication point for this software.

This project is registered within the PyPi, so, yes, I want it to be
installed as easy as:

pip3 install -U org_wayround_pyeditor

This project depends on My other project - org_wayround_utils - it
should be downloaded and installed automatically with above pip
command.
