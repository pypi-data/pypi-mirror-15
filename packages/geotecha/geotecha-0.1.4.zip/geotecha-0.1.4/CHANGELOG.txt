2016-05-31 geotecha-0.1.4 Release.
           Added YinAndGrahamSoilModel voidratio_stress relationship.
           Added Elasto-Plastic for Unsaturated Soils (EPUS) based on
           Pham (2005). beam_on_foundation sub-package including
           Ding et al (2012) "Finite elastic Euler-Bernoulli
           beam resting on non-linear viscoelastic foundation
           subjected to a moving load." . Some bug fixes.
           Fixed docs to have correct autosummary.
2016-05-31 Fixed py27 bug in
           geotecha.constitutive_models.void_ratio_stress.CcCrSoilModel.av_from_stress
           Previously Cx = chooser[np.sign(estress - pstress, dtype=int)]
           sometimes threw a type casting error.  Fixed by replacing with the
           following.
           Cx = chooser[np.array(np.sign(estress - pstress), dtype=int)]
2016-05-30 Fixed issue with YinAndGrahamSoilModel throwing error in
           geotecha.constitutive_models.void_ratio_stress when
           non-array inputs are used for t0, estress0, pstress0, e0.
           The fix does a number of 'if np.isscalar' checks so
           may slow down code.
2016-05-30 In docs\conf.  changed code "html_theme = 'default'" to
           "html_style = 'default.css'".  This is so new Sphinx version
           can find style sheet for doc building. Also added
           sphinx>=1.4 dependency to setup.py.
2016-05-30 Tidied up some docstrings in Ding et al 2102, epus etc.
2016-05-30 Added YinAndGrahamSoilModel soil model to
           geotecha.constitutive_models.void_ratio_stress
           Note: not fully tested.
2016-03-15 Added geotecha.beam_on_foundation.dingetal2012
           implementing Ding et al. 2012, '"Convergence of Galerkin
           truncation for dynamic response of finite beams on
           nonlinear foundations under a moving load."
           Journal of Sound and Vibration, 331(10), 2426-2442.
           Test routine provided.
2016-03-15 Added subpackage geotecha.beam_on_foundation.
           Beams on ealstic foundations, winkler foundations etc.
2016-03-15 Generated new code for spectral galerkin method integration.
           Integration is dim1sin_DD_abDDf_linear for use with beams.
           Generation code and result code incorporated into:
           geotecha.speccon.integrals_generate_code
           geotecha.speccon.integrals
           geotecha.speccon.ext_integrals
           geotecha.speccon.tests.test_integrals
2015-11-23 In geotecha.constitutive_models.epus.EpusProfile the profile now
           has a point just above and just below the water table.
           This is where rapid changes in unsaturated soil properties
           is likely to occur
2015-11-09 Added '--doctest-options=+IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL' to nose
           testing routines in
           tools\test_with_nose and tools\tests_with_nose_with_coverage
           and the description in README.rst.  Now when running
           geotecha tests the exception detail is ignored.  Previously
           there were some python version issues.
2015-11-09 In HansboNonDarcianFlowModel class in
           geotecha.constitutive_models.velocity_hydraulic_gradient
            it now uses geotecha.mathematics.rootfinding._fixed_point
            instead of error producing scipy.optimize.fixed_point.
2015-11-09 As at 20151106 scipy.optimize.fixed_point may not
           converge for all functions because it uses convergence
           acceleration.  I added a non-convergence acceleration
           version '_fixed_point' to geotecha.mathematics.rootfinding.
2015-10-21 In MarkersDashesColors class of
           geotecha.plotting.one_d, markers will now default to
           filled.
2015-06-23 Added geotecha.plotting.one_d.save_figure to easily save
           multiple versions of a matplotlib figure.
2015-06-18 Added constitutive_models.epus elasto-plastic unsaturated
           soil.  A python version of teh visual basic code in the
           appendix of Pham (2005) PhD thesis.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2015-02-13 geotecha-0.1.3 Release. Now compatible with python-2.7 and
           python-3.4.  32 and 64-bit windows binaries available on
           pypi. Added many speccon examples. Updated
	         README.rst so that github and pipy have nice looking
           front pages. Expanded permissible numpy functions in
	         inputoutput syntax_checker.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2015-01-30 geotecha-0.1.2 Release.  Similar release to 0.1.1 but with
           with important changes to docs.  Added sphinx extensions
           gen_api_rst_files.py and gen_examples_rst_files.py which
           auto generate the api rst files and the example docs when
           I make the docs with 'make html'.  Now I gan just add
           example files and have them appear in the docs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2015-01-14 geotecha-0.1.1 Release.  This is the version that works on
           Rohan's computer based on pythonxy-2.7.6.1.  I anticipate
           some missing requirements in setup.py.  Also I have used
           'python setup.py build --compiler=mingw32' when building
           the extensions etc.  I think later versions of pythonxy
           do not have mingw so I'll adjust accordingly.

2013-05-01 Approximate start of geotecha project. Version 0.1.0.
