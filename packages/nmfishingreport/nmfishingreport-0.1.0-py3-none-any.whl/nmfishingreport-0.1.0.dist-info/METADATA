NM Fishing Report
=================

|Build Status|

Scrapes the NM Dept of Game and Fish fishing report

-  Free software: MIT
-  Documentation: https://nmfishingreport.readthedocs.org

Features
--------

-  Scrapes fishing report into sqlite database
-  Writes to a text file the reports for a specified list of spots

   -  Basic Markdown format
   -  I use this to output to a Dropbox folder for easy access on mobile

-  Monitors for keywords and can optionally use a custom notification
   script when those keywords appear in a report

Introduction
------------

The NM Dept of Game and Fish publishes `a biweekly fishing
report <http://www.wildlife.state.nm.us/fishing/weekly-report/>`__. This
script scrapes the report into a database so I can see how various spots
fare throughout the year. It send me a
`Pushover <https://pushover.net/>`__ notification whenever the report
for one of my favorite spots has any of the buzzwords I've selected.

Dependencies
------------

-  Python3
-  OS X or Linux
-  See ``requirements.txt``

Quickstart
----------

1. Copy ``config-sample.ini`` (recommended: rename to ``config.ini``,
   which is ``.gitignore``\ d)
2. Modify config (see section below)
3. ``pip3 install nmfishingreport``
4. ``python3 -m nmfishingreport -c /path/to/your-config.ini``

Development Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Clone the repo:
   ``git clone https://github.com/n8henrie/nmfishingreport && cd    nmfishingreport``
2. Make a virtualenv: ``python3 -m venv venv``
3. Install dev setup: ``venv/bin/pip install .[dev]``

Configuration
-------------

I recommend you start with ``config-sample.ini``. I've tried to add
comments to make it somewhat self-explanatory. A few notes:

-  You'll need to make sure your spelling matches NMDGF for
   ``fav_spots``.
-  I've included my database file with some reports going back to 2015

   -  There are likely several holes from times when the NMDGF updated
      their website and broke the script or times that my computer
      wasn't running
   -  If you want to want to continue with my existing database, copy it
      to a more reasonable filename (recommended:
      ``fishing_reports.db``), and use it as ``db`` in your config
   -  The filename ``fishing_reports.db`` is ``.gitignore``-d
   -  I'll try to update the provided file from time to time

Notification config
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you know a bit of Python, you can optionally provide a notification
script if you want to get a push notification (or email or what have
you) when certain keywords show up in the report for one of your
``fav_spots``. The file should expose a bare function ``notify`` that
accepts two arguemnts:

1. A dictionary containing the following keys:

   -  ``spot``: the fishing spot triggering the notification
   -  ``report``: the text of that spot's fishing report
   -  ``url``: the URL for the fishing report

2. The path to your config file

Because it accepts a path to your config file, you can add a section to
your config file to include usernames and passwords for the notification
script if needed. For example, in the ``extras/`` directory I've
included my (working) ``notify.py`` for Pushover -- it pulls my Pushover
credentials from my config file, which is kept out of version control.

Be forewarned that ``nmfishingreport`` loads the notification script to
``exec``\ ing its contents, which I'm sure could have security
ramifications or lead to data loss if you aren't careful. Leave the
``NOTIFY`` section out of your config to avoid this entirely.

Troubleshooting / FAQ / Examples
--------------------------------

-  How can I get info out of an sqlite database?

   -  I'm not terribly good at sqlite either, so here's how to convert
      it to a csv file that you can open in your spreadsheet app of
      choice:
   -  ``sqlite3 -header -csv fishing_reports.db "SELECT * FROM nm_fishing_reports;" > fishingreport.csv``

-  Some other ideas on looking at the contents:

   -  Dump all reports to your screen:

      -  ``sqlite3 fishing_reports.db 'SELECT * FROM nm_fishing_reports;'``

   -  Show the 10 most recent reports:

      -  ``sqlite3 fishing_reports.db 'SELECT * FROM nm_fishing_reports ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 10;'``

   -  Show the 5 most recent reports for the Jemez waters:

      -  ``sqlite3 fishing_reports.db 'SELECT date, report FROM nm_fishing_reports WHERE spot LIKE "%Jemez%" ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 5;'``

   -  Show the most recent spot to have had the word "excellent" in the
      report:

      -  ``sqlite3 fishing_reports.db 'SELECT date, spot FROM nm_fishing_reports WHERE report LIKE "% excellent %" ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 1;'``

   -  Show what times of year the Jemez fishing has been "very good" or
      "excellent":

      -  ``sqlite3 fishing_reports.db 'SELECT date FROM nm_fishing_reports WHERE (report LIKE "% very good %" OR report LIKE "% excellent %") AND spot LIKE "%Jemez%";'``

-  How can I run ``nmfishingreport`` automatically?

   -  If you're on OS X, I've included an example launchd plist in
      ``extras/``
