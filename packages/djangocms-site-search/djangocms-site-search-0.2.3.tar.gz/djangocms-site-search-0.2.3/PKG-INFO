        The reason I created this was simply to avoid the overhead of using third party applications such as haystack.
        I was deploying an app on Amazons Elastic Beanstalk that will run on one or more instance and did not
        want the hassle of trying to save the index results in a centralized storage. I also did not want another instance
        just to act as a search endpoint like solr etc.
        
        Doing it this way by saving the results in the database makes it extremely portable.
        
        On publishing a page, an index item is added to the model.
        On unpublishing or deleting its removed.
