.SH NAME
.PP
barman \- backup and recovery manager for PostgreSQL
.SH CONFIGURATION FILE LOCATIONS
.PP
The system\-level Barman configuration file is located at
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/etc/barman.conf
\f[]
.fi
.PP
or
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/etc/barman/barman.conf

and is overridden on a per\-user level by
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$HOME/.barman.conf
\f[]
.fi
.SH CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX
.PP
The Barman configuration file is a plain \f[C]INI\f[] file.
There is a general section called \f[C][barman]\f[] and a section
\f[C][servername]\f[] for each server you want to backup.
Rows starting with \f[C];\f[] are comments.
.SH CONFIGURATION FILE DIRECTORY
.PP
Barman supports the inclusion of multiple configuration files, through
the \f[C]configuration_files_directory\f[] option.
Included files must contain only server specifications, not global
configurations.
If the value of \f[C]configuration_files_directory\f[] is a directory,
Barman reads all files with \f[C]\&.conf\f[] extension that exist in
that folder.
For example, if you set it to \f[C]/etc/barman.d\f[], you can specify
your PostgreSQL servers placing each section in a separate
\f[C]\&.conf\f[] file inside the \f[C]/etc/barman.d\f[] folder.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B active
When set to \f[C]true\f[] (default), the server is in full operational
state.
When set to \f[C]false\f[], the server can be used for diagnostics, but
any operational command such as backup execution or WAL archiving is
temporarily disabled.
Setting \f[C]active=false\f[] is a good practice when adding a new node
to Barman.
Server.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B archiver
This option allows you to activate log file shipping through
PostgreSQL\[aq]s \f[C]archive_command\f[] for a server.
If set to \f[C]true\f[] (default), Barman expects that continous
archiving for a server is in place and will activate checks as well as
management (including compression) of WAL files that Postgres deposits
in the \f[I]incoming\f[] directory.
Setting it to \f[C]false\f[], will disable standard continuous archiving
for a server.
Global/Server.
(NOTE: this option is currently required to be enabled until Barman
natively supports physical replication slots.
Setting it to \f[C]false\f[] will result in a disabled server).
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B backup_directory
Directory where backup data for a server will be placed.
Server.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B backup_method
Configure the way barman executes a backup.
Currently, only \f[C]rsync\f[].
Global/Server.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B backup_options
This option allows you to control the way Barman interacts with
PostgreSQL for backups.
If set to \f[C]exclusive_backup\f[] (default), \f[C]barman\ backup\f[]
executes backup operations using the standard exclusive backup approach
(technically through pg_start_backup/pg_stop_backup).
If set to \f[C]concurrent_backup\f[], Barman requires the
\f[C]pgespresso\f[] module to be installed on the PostgreSQL server
(this allows you to perform a backup from a standby server).
Global/Server.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B bandwidth_limit
This option allows you to specify a maximum transfer rate in kilobytes
per second.
A value of zero specifies no limit (default).

Number of retries of base backup copy, after an error.
Used during both backup and recovery operations.
Positive integer, default 0.

.RE
.TP
.B compression
Standard compression algorithm applied to WAL files.
Possible values are: \f[C]gzip\f[] (requires \f[C]gzip\f[] to be
installed on the system), \f[C]bzip2\f[] (requires \f[C]bzip2\f[]),
\f[C]pigz\f[] (requires \f[C]pigz\f[]), \f[C]pygzip\f[] (Python\[aq]s
internal gzip compressor) and \f[C]pybzip2\f[] (Python\[aq]s internal
bzip2 compressor).

.RS
.RE
.TP
.B errors_directory
Directory that contains WAL files that contain an error; usually this is
related to a conflict with an existing WAL file (e.g.
a WAL file that has been archived after a streamed one).
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B immediate_checkpoint
This option allows you to control the way PostgreSQL handles checkpoint
at the start of the backup.
If set to \f[C]false\f[] (default), the I/O workload for the checkpoint
will be limited, according to the \f[C]checkpoint_completion_target\f[]
setting on the PostgreSQL server.
If set to \f[C]true\f[], an immediate checkpoint will be requested,
meaning that PostgreSQL will complete the checkpoint as soon as
possible.
Global/Server.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B incoming_wals_directory
Directory where incoming WAL files are archived into.
Requires \f[C]archiver\f[] to be enabled.
Server.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B last_backup_maximum_age
This option identifies a time frame that must contain the latest backup.
If the latest backup is older than the time frame, barman check command
will report an error to the user.
If empty (default), latest backup is always considered valid.
Syntax for this option is: "i (DAYS | WEEKS | MONTHS)" where i is a
integer greater than zero, representing the number of days | weeks |
months of the time frame.

.TP
.B network_compression
This option allows you to enable data compression for network transfers.
If set to \f[C]false\f[] (default), no compression is used.
If set to \f[C]true\f[], compression is enabled, reducing network usage.
Global/Server.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B path_prefix
One or more absolute paths, separated by colon, where Barman looks for
executable files.
The paths specified in \f[C]path_prefix\f[] are tried before the ones
specified in \f[C]PATH\f[] environment variable.
Global/server.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B post_archive_retry_script
Hook script launched after a WAL file is archived by maintenance.
Being this a \f[I]retry\f[] hook script, Barman will retry the execution
of the script until this either returns a SUCCESS (0), an ABORT_CONTINUE
(62) or an ABORT_STOP (63) code.
In a post archive scenario, ABORT_STOP has currently the same effects as
ABORT_CONTINUE.

Being this a \f[I]retry\f[] hook script, Barman will retry the execution
of the script until this either returns a SUCCESS (0), an ABORT_CONTINUE

.B pre_archive_retry_script
Hook script launched before a WAL file is archived by maintenance, after
\[aq]pre_archive_script\[aq].
Being this a \f[I]retry\f[] hook script, Barman will retry the execution
of the script until this either returns a SUCCESS (0), an ABORT_CONTINUE
(62) or an ABORT_STOP (63) code.
Returning ABORT_STOP will propagate the failure at a higher level and
interrupt the WAL archiving operation.

.B recovery_options
Options for recovery operations.
Currently only supports \f[C]get\-wal\f[].
\f[C]get\-wal\f[] activates generation of a basic
\f[C]restore_command\f[] in the resulting \f[C]recovery.conf\f[] file
that uses the \f[C]barman\ get\-wal\f[] command to fetch WAL files
directly from Barman\[aq]s archive of WALs.
Comma separated list of values, default empty.
Global/Server.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B retention_policy
Policy for retention of periodic backups and archive logs.
If left empty, retention policies are not enforced.
For redundancy based retention policy use "REDUNDANCY i" (where i is an
integer > 0 and defines the number of backups to retain).
For recovery window retention policy use "RECOVERY WINDOW OF i DAYS" or
"RECOVERY WINDOW OF i WEEKS" or "RECOVERY WINDOW OF i MONTHS" where i is
a positive integer representing, specifically, the number of days, weeks
or months to retain your backups.
For more detailed information, refer to the official documentation.
Default value is empty.

.RE
.TP
.B retention_policy_mode
Currently only "auto" is implemented.

.RE
.TP
.B reuse_backup
This option controls incremental backup support.
Global/Server.
Possible values are: * \f[C]off\f[]: disabled (default); *
\f[C]copy\f[]: reuse the last available backup for a server and create a
copy of the unchanged files (reduce backup time); * \f[C]link\f[]: reuse
the last available backup for a server and create a hard link of the
unchanged files (reduce backup time and space).
Requires operating system and file system support for hard links.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B streaming_archiver
This option allows you to use the PostgreSQL\[aq]s streaming protocol to
receive transaction logs from a server.
If set to \f[C]on\f[], Barman expects to find \f[C]pg_receivexlog\f[] in
the PATH (see \f[C]path\f[] option) and that streaming connection for
the server is working.
This activates connection checks as well as management (including
compression) of WAL files.
If set to \f[C]off\f[] (default) barman will rely only on continuous
archiving for a server WAL archive operations, eventually terminating
any running \f[C]pg_receivexlog\f[] for the server.
Global/Server.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B streaming_archiver_name
Identifier to be used as \f[C]application_name\f[] by the

By default it is set to \f[C]barman_receive_wal\f[].
