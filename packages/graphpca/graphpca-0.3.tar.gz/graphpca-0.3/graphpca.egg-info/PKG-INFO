Description: graphpca
        ===========
        
        Produces a low-dimensional representation of the input graph.
        
        Calculates the ETCD [1]_ of the graph and reduces its dimension using PCA. The
        result is an embedding of the graph nodes as vectors in a low-dimensional
        space.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        ::
        
            >>> import networkx as nx
            >>> import graphpca
            >>> g = nx.erdos_renyi_graph(10000, 0.2)
            >>> g_2 = graphpca.reduce_graph(g, 2)
            >>> graphca.plot_2d(g_2)
