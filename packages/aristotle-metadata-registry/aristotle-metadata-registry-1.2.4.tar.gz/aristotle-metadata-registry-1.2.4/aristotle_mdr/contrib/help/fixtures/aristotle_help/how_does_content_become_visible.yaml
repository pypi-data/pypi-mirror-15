    body: >
        <h2>Before registration</h2>
        <p>Before an item has been registered, they are only visible to logged in members, and as
        such the visibilty of an item is a relatively straight forward process, and is explained in the steps below.
        It is important to note, that registration does not imply standardisation, just that the item can be given a status by a registration authority.</p>
        <p>In the below table <em>"the workgroup"</em> should be taken to mean <em>the workgroup the item resides in</em>.</p>
        <table class="table table-striped">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Action</th>
                    <th>Actor</th>
                    <th>Visibility</th>
                    <th>Example</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>A new workgroup is created and one or more Registration Authorities are associated with it.
                    </td>
                    <td>Any superuser</td>
                    <td> - (No item is created yet)
                    </td>
                    <td>The workgroup <em>"Housing assets"</em> is created for tracking economic housing factors,
                        and two registration authorities are attached - "Housing" and "Economic statistics".
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>An item is created in a specific workgroup.
                    </td>
                    <td>Any editor in the workgroup.
                    </td>
                    <td>Only members of that workgroup.
                    </td>
                    <td>A new <em>"Household"</em> Object Class is created for tracking household spending, this
                        is only visible to members of the <em>"housing assets"</em> workgroup.
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>An item is marked as "ready to review"
                    </td>
                    <td>Any editor in the workgroup.
                    </td>
                    <td>Any registrar for the registration authorities that are associated with a workgroup,
                        and members of the workgroup the item resides in.
                    </td>
                    <td>The "Household" Object Class is marked ready to review, and can be seen by
                        members of the "Housing assets" workgroup, as well as registrars of the
                        "Housing" and "Economic statistics" registration authorities.
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        
        <h2>After registration</h2>
        
        <p>Once an item is registered it may become "publically visible" to non-members.
        In fact <strong>registration is the <em>only</em> way for an administered item to become publically visible.</strong></p>
        <p>Because of this, who can view an item becomes a more complex process to determine, however can be summed up as such:</p>
        <blockquote>An item is visible if, and only if, it has a been given a registration status that is marked as
        "publically viewable" by the registration authorities who are associated with its workgroup.</blockquote>
        <p>Using the example in the previous table, this can be explained like so:
            <ul>
                <li>The <em>"Household"</em> Object Class can be considered to be owned by the <em>"Housing assets"</em>
                    workgroup, under the authority of the "Housing" and "Economic statistics" registration authorities.</li>
                <li>The "housing" registration authority considers items that are of status "Candidate" or above to be public.</li>
                <li>If the "housing" registration authority registers the "Household" item with status "Candidate" it will be public, regardless of the rules set out by the "Economic statistics" registration authority</li>
                <li>If neither the "Housing" or "Economic statistics" registration authorities have given the "Household" object class a "public" status it will remain visible according to the table above.</li>
                <li>If due to these permissions are registrar in another authority can see the "Household" object class and registers it in a third registration authority, this will have <em>no</em> bearing on the items visibilty.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
