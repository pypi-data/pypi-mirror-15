      <blockquote>
      The primary purpose of ISO/IEC 11179-3 is to specify the structure of a Metadata Registry.
      ISO/IEC 11179-3 also specifies basic attributes which are required to describe metadata items, and which
      may be used in situations where a complete metadata registry is not appropriate (e.g. in the specification of
      other International Standards).
