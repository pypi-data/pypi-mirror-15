Keras Diagram
=============

Print ASCII diagrams of your
`Keras <https://github.com/fchollet/keras>`__ models to visualize the
layers and their shapes.

A simple example:

::

          InputLayer (None, 50, 300)
             Reshape (None, 1, 50, 300)
       Convolution2D (None, 250, 48, 1)
                Relu (None, 250, 48, 1)
        MaxPooling2D (None, 250, 1, 1)
             Flatten (None, 250)
             Dropout (None, 250)
               Dense (None, 7)
             Softmax (None, 7)
