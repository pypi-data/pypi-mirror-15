Brandon, the devpi builder, takes a ``requirements.txt`` and incrementally fills a devpi_ index with wheels of the listed python packages.


Brandon by Example
==================

Given a ``requirements.txt``, we can upload all listed packages to the index ``opensource/Debian_7`` on a local devpi using the following command::

    $ devpi-builder requirements.txt http://localhost:3141/opensource/Debian_7 opensource mypassword

Example of such a ``requirements.txt``::

    progressbar==0.2.2 
    progressbar==0.2.1 
    PyYAML==3.11

Commandline Usage
=================
::

    usage: devpi-builder [-h] [--blacklist BLACKLIST] [--pure-index PURE_INDEX]
                         [--junit-xml JUNIT_XML] [--dry-run]
                         [--client-cert CLIENT_CERT]
                         requirements index user password

    Create wheels for all given project versions and upload them to the given
    index.

    positional arguments:
      requirements          requirements.txt style file specifying which project
                            versions to package.
      index                 The index to upload the packaged software to.
      user                  The user to log in as.
      password              Password of the user.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --blacklist BLACKLIST
                            Packages matched by this requirements.txt style file
                            will never be build.
      --pure-index PURE_INDEX
                            The index to use for pure packages. Any non-pure
                            package will be uploaded to the index given as
                            positional argument. Packages already found in the
                            pure index will not be built, either.
      --junit-xml JUNIT_XML
                            Write information about the build success / failure to
                            a JUnit-compatible XML file.
      --dry-run             Build missing wheels, but do not modify the state of
                            the devpi server.
      --client-cert CLIENT_CERT
                            Client key to use to authenticate with the devpi
                            server.

Features
========

* Read a ``requirements.txt`` style input file.
* Support multiple versions of a package in the same file 
* Only build packages not yet in the target index.
* Support a black-list for packages to never be built and uploaded (certain packages like numpy are fragile regarding their interdependency with other packages).
* Can use separate indices for plain python packages and those with binary contents.
* Can log build results to a JUnit compatible XML file, thus that it can be parsed by Jenkins.

Changelog
=========

This lists the most important changes for each release.


v2.2.0 (May 05 2016)
====================

- Capture build errors for better output in case of build failures. Thanks Travis Mehlinger.


v2.1.0 (Apr 22 2016)
====================

- Add support for client certificates. Thanks Hans Lawrenz.


v2.0.0 (Jan 20 2016)
====================

- Enable compatibility with pip >= 8.0 by relying on pip's default download cache
  mechanism instead of explicitly requiring a download cache. This effectively
  disables caching for people still using pip < 6.0.
  Thanks Christian Stefanescu.
- Support for dry-running the wheel build without changing the devpi server state.
- Python 3.5 is now officially supported.
- Python 3.2 is no longer supported.


v1.0.0 (May 22 2015)
====================

- Use devpi-plumber_ instead of a custom devpi wrapper.
- Check the blacklist first when deciding whether to build a package.


v0.4.0 (Nov 13 2014)
====================

- Only consider a package to exist if it is a wheel and it is compatible with
  the current system. Thanks Michael Still and David Szotten
- Fix source distribution by adding missing README.md.
  Thanks Mikhail Lukyanchenko.


v0.3.0 (Aug 15 2014)
====================

- support for special-case handling of pure python wheels 
- optional support for report skipped packages in a JUnit-compatible XML
- Python 3 support


v0.2.1 (Aug 07 2014)
====================

- fix crash if a build wheel could cannot be found
  (because pip<=1.5.2 skipped it)


v0.2.0 (Aug 01 2014)
====================

- support for package blacklisting to never build certain wheels
- build as many packages as possible. Do not stop if one fails.


v0.1.0 (Aug 01 2014)
====================

- Initial release
