        =========
        
        Mock and memory leak detector library.  Right now this just features a plugin
        for Nose 1.x and is in **beta**.
        
        This plugin:
        - Detects mocks that are not reset between tests.
        - Detects mocks created during tests that are not deleted by the end of the test.
        - Reports memory delta between tests.  Optional.

        .org/wiki/Hans_Brinker,_or_The_Silver_Skates>`_.
        
        Pull requests are welcome.  In particular, area I'm looking to improve are:
        - adding a pytest test runner
        - improving memory delta reporting
