Mock and memory leak detector library.  Right now this just features a plugin
for Nose 1.x and is in **beta**.

This plugin:
- Detects mocks that are not reset between tests.
- Detects mocks created during tests that are not deleted by the end of the test.
- Reports memory delta between tests.  Optional.

To learn the story of the name, visit `<https://en.wikipedia
.org/wiki/Hans_Brinker,_or_The_Silver_Skates>`_.

Pull requests are welcome.  In particular, area I'm looking to improve are:
- adding a pytest test runner
- improving memory delta reporting
