            SetResolution

        :Description:

            This function sets the resolution of the SAR ADCs only. This method is unavailable for the DELSIG ADC. 
            The resolution is defaulted to 12, so this method is only needed if this needs to be changed  

        :param resolution:

            An integer value, in bits, that represents the new resolution of the SAR ADC. Valid arguments are *8, 10, or 12* only 

        :type resolution:

            int

        :returns:

            None

        .. note::

            The ADC resolution cannot be changed during a conversion cycle. The recommended bestpractice is to stop conversions with :meth:`~Stop` before changing the resolution, and then restarting with :meth:`~Start`
            If you call :meth:`~SetResolution` during a conversion, the resolution will not change until the current conversion is complete, and data will not be available in the new resolution for another 6+resolution clock cycles
