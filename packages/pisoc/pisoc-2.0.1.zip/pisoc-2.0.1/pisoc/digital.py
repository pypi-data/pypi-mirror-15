class DigitalPin(object):
    """
    :Class:

        Provides functionality for use of the GPIO on the PiSoC as a digital input or output, with a number of different drive mode configurations.

    :Example:

        Define a DigitalPin object in the following way::

            >>>My_input = DigitalPin(port,pin,'input')
            >>>My_output = DigitalPin(port,pin,'output')


    .. note::

        Modification of which pins are available should be easy. Just add new pins to you PiSoC schematic, give them an input and an output, and then name them as GPIO_PORT_PIN.
        After you do this, confirm that it was done correctly by using the info qualifier when constructing the PiSoC class.

            A servo with channel n, will make PWM(n) unnavailable, since the servo controller is implemented using that PWM object. 
            For fine control over that PWM, you can expose the internal use of the PWM instance using My_servo.servo_PWM, and then you can use any of the PWM methods using My_servo.servo_PWM.method(). 
            This is advised against though, because servos are very particular about the construction of their data signals. 
            If you change the wrong parameter of the PWM signal, you might damage the motor.
