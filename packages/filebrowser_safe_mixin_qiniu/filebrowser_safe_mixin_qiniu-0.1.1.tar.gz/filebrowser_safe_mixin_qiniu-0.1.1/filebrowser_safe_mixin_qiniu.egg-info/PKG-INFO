Description: Overview
        ========
        
        Some methods are necessary for `filebrowser_safe` to browse the file storage
        (e.g. `isfile`, `isdir`). Which can be achived by defining a `Mixin` class.
        
        filebrowser_safe contains `Mixin` classes for famous storage providers like Amazon or Google.
        
        Qiniu is a file service provider in China and of course not in the list.
        
        This project defines an extension for filebrowser_safe to make it work with QiniuStorage (django-qiniu-storage).
        
        # Usage
        
        
        `pip install filebrowser-safe-mixin-qiniu`
        
        Then, add the following lines at your django application's entry point.
        
        
        ```python
        from qiniustorage.backends import QiniuStorage
        from filebrowser_safe_mixin_qiniu.storage import QiniuStorageMixin
        
        if QiniuStorageMixin not in QiniuStorage.__bases__:
            QiniuStorage.__bases__ += (QiniuStorageMixin,)
        ```
