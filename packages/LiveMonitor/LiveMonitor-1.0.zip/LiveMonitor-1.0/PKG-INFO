        by Ryan Birmingham
        
        ==note that testing is underway==
        LiveMonitor allows for you to check on the status of your network services and devices. Check port status, see networked host information, and check log summaries.
        
        Check ports: Define hosts and ports to check; check specific ports on specitic hosts, or ports on all hosts. LiveMonitor will asyncrounously check so you can get a concice picture of your network.
        
        Check hosts: Quickly determine what's new and what's missing on your network.
        
        Check logs: Write a rule to parse a log format, or use one of the existing ones. See warnings, errors, and odd behavior on multiple services on multiple hosts in one place.
        
        
        ==Currently under development==
