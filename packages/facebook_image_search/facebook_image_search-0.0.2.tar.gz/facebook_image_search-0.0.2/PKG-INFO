Description: Facebook Image Graph Search
        ===========================
        
        Due to the advent of Post Search , it's difficult to use the feature of "Photos of" which was earlier done using 
        graph search . This application aims to solve that problem. 
        
        Extension 1 :
        -------------
        
        The profile picture of a given username is also opened in a new tab with original (maximum) size. 
        
        Extension 2 :
        -------------
        
        Gets the open images of a public profile. 
        
        Preconditions :
        ---------------
        
        Graph search doesn't work until you are logged into your account while the extension works otherwise also.

        Usage :
