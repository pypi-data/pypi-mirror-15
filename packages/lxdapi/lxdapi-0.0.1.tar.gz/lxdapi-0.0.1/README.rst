This library includes basic helpers encapsulating boring business logic code
for interacting with the lxd daemon. It is an experimental alternative to the
pylxd approach. The purpose of this library is **not** to be a full blown
framework for interacting with lxd completely abstracting HTTP transactions in
an hermetic way, pylxd already does a good job at that.
