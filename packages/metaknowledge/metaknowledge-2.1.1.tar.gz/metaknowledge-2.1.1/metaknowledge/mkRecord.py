    """A dictionary with error handling and an id string.

    `Record` is the base class of the all objects in _metaknowledge_ that contain information as key-value pairs, these are the grants and the records from different sources.

    The error handling of the `Record` is done with the `bad` attribute. If there is some issue with the data _bad_ should be `True` and _error_ given an `Exception` that was caused by or explains the error.

    # Customizations

    `Record` is a subclass of `abc.collections.Mapping` which means it has almost all the methods a dictionary does, the missing ones are those that modify entries. So to access the value of the key `'title'` from a `Record` `R`, you would use either the square brace notation `t = R['title']` or the `get()` function `t = R.get('title')` just like a dictionary. The other methods like `keys()` or `copy()` also work.

    In addition to being a mapping `Records` are also hashable with their hashes being based on a unique id string they are given on creation, usually some kind of accession number the source gives them. The two optional arguments _sFile_ and _sLine_, which should be given the name of the file the records came from and the line it started on respectively, are used to make the errors more useful.

    # \_\_Init\_\_

    _fieldDict_ is the dictionary the `Record` will use and _idValue_ is the unique identifier of the `Record`.

class ExtendedRecord(Record, metaclass = abc.ABCMeta):
    """A subclass of `Record` that adds processing to the dictionary. It also cannot be use directly and must be subclassed.

    The `ExtendedRecord` class is a extension of `Record` that is intended for use with the records on scientific papers provided by different organizations such as WOS or Pubmed. The 5 abstract (virtual) methods must be defined for each subclass and define how the data in the different fields is processed and how the record can be rewritten to a file.

    # Processing fields

    When an `ExtendedRecord` is created a dictionary, _fieldDict_, must be provided this contains the raw data from the file reader, usually as lists of strings. `tagProcessingFunc` is a `staticmethod` function that takes in a tag string an returns another function to process it.

    Each tag may also be given a second name, as usually what the they are called in the raw data are not very easy to understand (e.g. `'SO'` is the journal name for WOs records). The mapping from the raw tag (`'SO'`) to the human friendly string (`'journal'`)  is done with the `getAltName` `staticmethod`. `getAltName` takes in a tag string and returns either `None` or the other name for that string. Note, `getAltName` must go both directions `WOSRecord.getAltName(WOSRecord.getAltName('SO')) == 'SO'`.

    The last method for processing entries is `specialFuncs` The following are the special keys for `ExtendedRecords`. These must be the alternate names of tags or strings accepted by the `specialFuncs` method.

    + `'authorsFull'`
    + `'keywords'`
    + `'grants'`
    + `'j9'`
    + `'authorsShort'`
    + `'volume'`
    + `'selfCitation'`
    + `'citations'`
    + `'address'`
    + `'abstract'`
    + `'title'`
    + `'month'`
    + `'year'`
    + `'journal'`
    + `'beginningPage'`
    + `'DOI'`

    `specialFuncs` when given one of these must raise a `KeyError` or return an object of the same type as that returned by the `MedlineRecord` or `WOSRecord`. e.g. `'title'` would return a string giving the title of the record.

    For an example of how this works lets first look at the `'SO'` tag on a `WOSRecord` accessed with the alternate name `'journal'`.

        t = R['journal']

    First the private dictionary `_computedFields` is checked for the key `'title'`, which will fail if this is the first time `'journal'` or `'SO'` has been requested, after this the results will be added to the dictionary to speed up future requests.

    Then the _fieldDict_ will be checked for the key and when that fails the key will go through `getAltName` and be checked again. If the record had a journal entry this will succeed and the raw data will be given to the `tagProcessingFunc` using the same key as _fieldDict_, in this case `SO`.

    The results will then be written to `_computedFields` and returned.

    If the requested key was instead `'grants'` (`g = R['grants']`)the both lookups to _fieldDict_ would have failed and the string `'grants'` would have been given to `specialFuncs` which would return a list of all the grants in the `WOSRecord` (this is always `[]` as WOS does not provided grant information).

    What if the key were not present anywhere? Then the `specialFuncs` should raise a `KeyError` which will be caught then re-raised like a dictionary would with an invalid key look up.

    # File Handling fields

    The two other required methods `encoding` and `writeRecord` define how the records can be rewritten to a file. `encoding` is should return a string giving the encoding python would use, e.g. `'utf-8'` or `'latin-1'`. This is the same encoding that the files written by `writeRecord` should have, `writeRecord` when called should write the original record to the provided open file, _infile_. The opening, closing, header and footer of the file will be handled by `RecordCollection`'s `writeFile` function which should me modified accordingly. If the order of the fields in a record is important you can use a [`collections.OrderedDict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict) for _fieldDict_.
