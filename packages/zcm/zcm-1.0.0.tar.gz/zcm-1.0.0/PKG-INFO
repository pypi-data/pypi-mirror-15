Description: ZeroMQ Component Model (ZCM) in Python
        ======================================
        
        Overview
        ---------
        
        * ZCM is a lightweight component model using ZeroMQ (http://zeromq.org/) 
        * Components are the building blocks of an application
        * Components are characterized by ports and timers. 
        * Timers are bound to an *operation* and fire periodically
        * There are four basic types of ports in ZCM: publisher, subscriber, client and server
        * Publishers publish messages and Subscribers receive messages
        * Clients request the services of a server by sending a request message; Servers receive such requests, process the requests, and respond back to the Client. Until the Server responds, the Client port blocks
        * A Component can be instantiated multiple times in an application with different port configurations
        * A component has a single operation queue that handles timer triggers and receives messages
        * A component has an executor thread that processes this operation queue
        * Components register functionality e.g. timer_operations, subscribers_operations etc. 
        * Component instances are grouped together into a process, called *Actor*
        * An actor receives a configuration (.JSON) file, that contains information regarding the components to instantiate
        * This configuration file also contains properties of all timers and ports contained by the component instances
