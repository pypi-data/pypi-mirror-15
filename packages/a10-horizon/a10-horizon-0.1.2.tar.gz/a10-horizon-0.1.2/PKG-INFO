        ## Installation steps:
        
        ### Step 1:
        
        Make sure you have horizon installed.  This dashboard will need to be installed on all of your Horizon nodes if you are running Horizon in an HA environment.
        
        
        ### Step 2:
        
        The latest supported version of a10-horizon is available via standard pypi repositories and the current development version is available on github.
        
        ##### Installation from pypi
        ```sh
        sudo pip install a10-horizon
        ```
        
        ##### Installation from cloned git repository.
        
        Download the dashboard from: <https://github.com/a10networks/a10-horizon>
        
        
        
        ```sh
        sudo pip install git+https://github.com/a10networks/a10-horizon.git
        ```
        
        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/a10networks/a10-horizon.git
        cd a10-horizon
        sudo pip install -e .
        ```
        
        ## Configuration
        
        Horizon provides a plugin architecture for adding external panels.  To enable the A10 Networks Horizon UI dashboard, simply copy the files from `a10_horizon/_enabled_hooks` to the `local/enabled` directory in your Horizon Openstack dashboard directory.  These paths can be auto-discovered by typing the following commands:
        
        ### a10-horizon path
        ```sh
        python -c "import a10_horizon; print(a10_horizon.__path__[0])"
        ```
        ### Horizon dashboard path
        ```sh
        python -c "import openstack_dashboard; print (openstack_dashboard.__path__[0])"
        ```
        ## Restart necessary services
        
        a10-horizon has static resources that must be "collected" by Horizon.  Following the installation of a10-horizon, execute the following command in the directory where you have installed Horizon:
        ```sh
        ./manage.py collectstatic
        ./manage.py compress
        ```
        
        Restart horizon after configuration updates (exact command may vary depending
          on OpenStack packaging.)
        
        ```sh
        service apache2 restart
        ```

        still go through standard A10 processes.
