karaage3 (3.0.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  General changes that might be required include:

  * Existing datastores should be based on base.MachineCategoryDataStore
    instead of base.baseDataStore

  * Some old methods in MachineCategoryDataStore are no longer used. In
    particular methods that deal with people (as opposed to accounts).
    These should be removed.

  * DATASTORES in /etc/karaage/global_settings.conf is now called
    MACHINE_CATEGORY_DATASTORES.

  * openldap_group needs to be renamed to openldap_account_group or
    ds389_group needs to be renamed to ds389_account_group in
    MACHINE_CATEGORY_DATASTORES.
