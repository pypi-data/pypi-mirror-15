MREDU
=====

A simple simulator of a system which implements map/reduce paradigm similarly to
how Apache Hadoop does.
Its objective is to be used as an educational tool to learn how to code
map/reduce algorithms without needing to install complex components.

Requirements
============
To use it you will need:

  * A Python interpreter and standard library. Tested with 2.7 and 3.5 versiÃ³ns of cpython.
  * Install required packages from PyPi:

    $> pip install mredu

Examples
========
There are several examples of use of the simulator in the examples directory.

  * example1: Does some calculations from a list of tuples.
  * example2: Calculates the histogram of the number of words per line in the
    file quijote.txt from data folder.
  * example3: The ubiquitous word-count example written to run on the simulator
    and applied to the same quijote.txt file.
  * example4: Inverse k,v -> v,k agrupation
