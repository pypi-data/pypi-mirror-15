Changelog
=========

2.2.0 (2016-05-03)
------------------
- Changed internal structure used to represent lists, from vector of size N
  to vector containing only the indices of the 1's. This saves memory and
  avoids storing redundant information.
- Added the `get_xlmhg_test_result()` front-end function, which returns an
  `mHGResult` object.

2.1.x updates
-------------
- 2.1.1 (2016-05-01): Fixed readme

2.1.0 (2016-05-01)
------------------
- Added Cython implementation for calculating XL-mHG E-scores
- Added `mHGResult` class for representing test results
- Added tests
- Fixed a few minor issues

2.0.x updates
-------------
- 2.0.7 (2016-04-21): Fixed small problem in setup script
- 2.0.5 (2016-04-19): Fixed an uninstended change introduced in 2.0.4 whereby
  a cythonized version instead of the mhg_cython.pyx file was included in the
  package
- 2.0.4 (2016-04-19): Added tests/ and CHANGELOG.rst to Manifest.in file
- 2.0.3 (2016-04-18): Including Travis CI build status in Readme
- 2.0.2 (2016-04-18): Integration with Travis CI
- 2.0.1 (2016-04-15): Readme fixes

2.0.0 (2016-04-15)
------------------
Major release with several new features:

- New API (`xlmhg.xlmhg_test()`; see `test.py`).
- Implementation of ``PVAL2`` algorithm for calculating XL-mHG p-values.
  This algorithm offers better performance and numerical stability and is
  now used by default.
- Implementation of ``PVAL-BOUND`` algorithm for calculating O(N)-bound.
- Implementation of ``PVAL-THRESH`` algorithm for deciding whether the
  XL-mHG p-value meets a given signifance level.
- Unit tests to ensure the correctness of all algorithms (using `pytest`).

For details regarding the algorithms, see `Wagner (PeerJ Preprints, 2016)
