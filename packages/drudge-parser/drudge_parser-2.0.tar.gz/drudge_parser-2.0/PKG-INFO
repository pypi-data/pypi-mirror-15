Description: A pretty simple parser for [Drudge Report](http://drudgereport.com). I find the site impossible to look at and wanted a way to more easily digest the information, as I like to keep tabs on lots of differing news outlets.
        
        This library has no external dependencies and supports Python 2.7+ (targeted for Python 3+)
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        PyPI
        
            pip install drudge_parser
        
        
        ## Usage
        
            import drudge_parser
        
            # You can use and feed the parser directly if you would like:
            parser = drudge_parser.DrudgeParser()
            parser.feed('<html string>')
            print(parser.articles)
        
            # Or just use the helper to scrape the current site:
            articles = drudge_parser.scrape_page()
            print(articles)
        
        Articles is a list of article groupings. These are ordered down the page, so they will always be TOP\_STORY, MAIN\_HEADLINE, followed by COLUMN (note that the column number is not included, there does not appear to be any real distinguishing reason for the separation).
        
        An article grouping looks like:
        
            {
                "images": [str],  # This often is just empty, never None
                "articles": [
                    #  These will be ordered by appearance, in some cases drudge
                    #  builds related titles on each other
                    {
                        "title": str,
                        "href": str
                    }
                ],  # Never None
                "location": str  # One of the drudge_parser.Location 'enumeration'
            }
