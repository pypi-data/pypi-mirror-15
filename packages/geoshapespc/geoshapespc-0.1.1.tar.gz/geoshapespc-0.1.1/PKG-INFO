        ===========
        
        The Geometric Shapes Point Cloud aims to provide the tools to perform the creation of point clouds around a geometric shape defined by the user's input. The code in this package is able to create both an evenly spaced point cloud and a pseudorandomly placed point cloud.
        This package was created in order to generate rough simulations of LiDAR returns point cloud over a defined and known 3D geometric shape.
        
        This package was developed while in my PhD research in the Department of Geography at University College London, supervised by Dr Mat Disney (Earth Observation/Remote Sensing).
