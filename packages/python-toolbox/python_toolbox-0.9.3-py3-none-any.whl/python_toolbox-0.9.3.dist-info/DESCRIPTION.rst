The Python Toolbox is a collection of Python tools for various tasks. It
contains:

 - ``python_toolbox.caching``: Tools for caching functions, class instances and
    properties.

 - ``python_toolbox.cute_iter_tools``: Tools for manipulating iterables. Adds
    useful functions not found in Python's built-in ``itertools``.

 - ``python_toolbox.context_management``: Pimping up your context managers.

 - ``python_toolbox.emitting``: A publisher-subscriber framework that doesn't
    abuse strings.

 - And many, *many* more! The Python Toolbox contains **100+** useful
   little tools.

Tests
=====

Test can be run by running the ``_test_python_toolbox.py`` script that's
installed automatically with the Python Toolbox.

When ``python_toolbox`` isn't installed, you may run ``nosetests`` at the repo
root to run the tests.
