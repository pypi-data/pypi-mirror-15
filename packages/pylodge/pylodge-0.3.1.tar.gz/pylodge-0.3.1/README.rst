Introduction
============

PyLodge is a framework that integrates the automated tests with Test Lodge. It will update the status of the test cases
in Test Lodge based on the execution status of the automation script. In case of Failed test cases, it will create a
defect in the issue tracker if the project in Test Lodge has the issue tracker configured.

Installation
============

To install pillage, type the following command in the command line

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install pylodge

Quickstart
==========

The user need to pass 4 basic arguments at the time of instantiating the PyLodge class.
They are the Test Lodge API endpoint URL, Test Lodge project, Test Lodge user name and Test Lodge password.
There are various ways that the user can pass these arguments.
The user can store these values in environment variables and then pass the values at the time of instantiating the
PyLodge class. Once the PyLodge class is instantiated, the user can call any of the following pylodge methods .

**1. fetch_and_save_project_id()**

This method returns the id of the specified test lodge project .

Usage example::

    pylodge_obj = pylodge.PyLodge(os.environ['TESTLODGE_USERNAME'], os.environ['TESTLODGE_PASSWORD'],
                              os.environ['TESTLODGE_PROJECT'], os.environ['TESTLODGE_API_URL'])

    project_id = pylodge_obj.fetch_and_save_project_id()

**2. create_test_run()**

This method will create a test run in Test Lodge including all test suites in it. It will return the run id of the
created test run.

Arguments:
run_name (optional) : The name of the test run that you want to create in test lodge. if this argument is not passed
pylodge will create a test run in Test Lodge by a default name The default test run name is

Usage example::

    pylodge_obj = pylodge.PyLodge(os.environ['TESTLODGE_USERNAME'], os.environ['TESTLODGE_PASSWORD'],
                                   os.environ['TESTLODGE_PROJECT'], os.environ['TESTLODGE_API_URL'])

Example Implementation with selenium webdriver, pytest, xdist and redis :
=========================================================================

My example assumes the test automation project directory structure as mentioned below and using pytest

myproject/

    pages/

        page1.py
        page2.py
        …
    tests/

        \__init__.py
        conftest.py

        module-1-folder/

        test_functional_test_group1.py

        module-2-folder/

        test_functional_test_group2.py
        …
    updatetestlodge.py

The actual tests are implemented as methods inside the test_functional_test_group1.py files. So each of those methods
will have a prefix as ‘test_’ as a standard pytest naming convention and then followed by the test lodge prefix .
For example if test_tc01_create_user() is the automated test, ‘create_user’ will be the associated manual test case
in test lodge and tc01 will be the prefix of that test case.

For our tests we used pytest and redis. The conftest_.py file for our implementation can be found here conftest_ .
Download and start the redis server before running the tests.

.. _conftest: https://gist.github.com/akondapalli/60165ad869f88d4f00bd#file-conftest-py
 
Once the automated scripts are run, the tests along with the execution status and the logs are saved in to redis keys.
You need to write another python script that will extract these reds keys and update the Test Lodge .
Here_ is the code that should be saved in a .py file and executed after all tests are run.
