        This project is a fork of `pysolr`, hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/toastdriven/pysolr. We
        offer a few minor improvements over `pysolr`, but we attempt to keep the APIs identical. However,
        it is impossible to offer a compatible API because Tornado coroutines are coroutines, and must
        therefore be used with Python's `yield` keyword.
        
        If you are trying to decide between `pysolr` and `pysolr-tornado`, we recommend `pysolr` unless you
        are already sure that you want to use Tornado.
        
        Versions
        --------
        
        With ``pysolr-tornado`` 4.0, the version numbers no longer correspond meaningfully to upstream
        versions. We made the decision to jump to a new major release because of the refactoring of the
        :class:`Results` class, which we view as backward incompatible. We sympathize with the upstream's
        decision to release this as a point release, because it is such a minor change in most situations,
        but it broke our client application and it may break yours too.
