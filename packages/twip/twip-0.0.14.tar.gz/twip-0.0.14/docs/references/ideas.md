## Sprint Ideas

- Invertible PrettyDict, FuzzyDict, PrettyCount, PrettyFuzzyDict with pull requests to collections on core 
    - simplified C-implementation of fuzzywuzzy and levenshtein?
    - use builtin re package?
    test in pug-nlp first
- AutoCoder for regexes
- Any Talentpair javascript or python modules with general utility
- Hack Oregon

## Open Space Ideas

- Text Adventure Games
    - playing together
    - building
    - Low-tech D&D?
- Robotics
- RaspberryPi Makeathon with Python
- Hack Oregon
- Public Data Hacking
- API/URL Hacks
- Autocoding
- NLP

## Lightning Talk Ideas

- Imbalanced NLP datasets (negative matches)
- Creating NLP training sets from databases
- Machine Learning Morality (Ethics)
    - Unbalanced training sets can come about by innocent means
        - Machines act the way we train them to
        - Human clicks are often very biased, especially when fast/instinctual
        - Human instincts were designed to react in a split second
        - Machines can think more deeply and longer so shouldn't be allowed to use decision shortcuts, generalizations
    - Talentpair -- Recruiting dilemma
        - Giving hiring managers what they want (their input trains the machine)
        - Filtering their training clicks to reduce bias
