Tweet Impact Predictor

Description
-----------

A natural language processing pipeline for predicting the impact (reach
and popularity) of a tweet. Built as part of the PyCon 2016 Natural
Language Processing tutorial and workshop. For more information see the
`tutorial
repository <https://github.com/totalgood/pycon-2016-nlp-tutorial>`__.

Don't install the latest version from PyPi if you're working through the
tutorial yourself! Tagged version numbers will correspond to sections of
the tutorial and handout material so you can maintain pace even if you
miss a step along the way. Plus it'll be easier to set up your API keys
if you clone the repository.

GETTING STARTED
---------------

Rather than installing this module from the cheese shop, fork the
repository on GitHub and then clone it to your laptop (replacing
``totalgood`` with your account name:

::

    git clone git@github.com:totalgood/twip.git
    cd twip
    git checkout v0.1.0

If you don't already have one, sign up to get a twitter user account
(@username): `twitter.com/signup <https://twitter.com/signup>`__

Once you have a user account, sign into it, then set up a twitter App to
get an ``API_KEY``:
`apps.twitter.com/app/new <https://apps.twitter.com/app/new>`__

Copy and paste the *Consumer API Key* and *Consumer API Secret* into the
indicated places in the file called ``settings_template.py`` but don't
save it there. Instead save the file as a new file named
``settings_secret.py``. This file is ``.gitignore``\ d during pushes. Do
a ``git status`` to make sure you didn't accidentally save your secret
KEYs in the template file or misname your ``settings_secret.py`` file.
If you see that any tracked/added files have changes then you need to
undo them before you do a commit and push to your fork of twip.

To get ready for the first workshop you'll want to make sure you've
checked out v0.1.0:

::

    git checkout v0.1.0

If you want to skip the first session and move directly to the second
session you can checkout ``v0.2.0``. This with have all the code from
the first workshop session completed for you.
