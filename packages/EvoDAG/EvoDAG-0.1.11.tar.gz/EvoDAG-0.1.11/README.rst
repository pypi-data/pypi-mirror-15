EvoDAG
======

Evolving Directed Acyclic Graph (EvoDAG) is a steady-state Genetic
Programming system with tournament selection. The main characteristic of
EvoDAG is that the genetic operation is performed at the root. EvoDAG
was inspired by the geometric semantic crossover proposed by `Alberto
Moraglio <https://scholar.google.com.mx/citations?user=0y4XRI0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao>`__
*et al.* and the implementation performed by `Leonardo
Vanneschi <https://scholar.google.com.mx/citations?user=uR5K07QAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao>`__
*et al*.
