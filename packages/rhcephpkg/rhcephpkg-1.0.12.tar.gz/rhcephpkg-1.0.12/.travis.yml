# We have to upgrade pytest explicitly here due to the following:
# * Travis CI's virtualenv already comes with pytest preinstalled.
# * pytest-flake8 requires pytest>=2.8, and sometimes this requirement is
#   higher than what Travis CI has pre-installed into the virtualenv.
# * 'python setup.py test' uses EasyInstall, so it will not upgrade a package
#   to a newer version if the package is already present in a virtualenv.
