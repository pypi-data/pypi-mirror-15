IPDB module
===========

Basically, IPDB is a transactional database, containing records,
that represent network stack objects. Any change in the database
is not reflected immediately in OS, but waits until `commit()`
is called. One failed operation during `commit()` rolls back all
the changes, has been made so far. Moreover, IPDB has commit
hooks API, that allows you to roll back changes depending on
your own function calls, e.g. when a host or a network becomes
unreachable.

IPDB vs. IPRoute
----------------

These two modules, IPRoute and IPDB, use completely different
approaches. The first one, IPRoute, just forward requests to
the kernel, and doesn't wait for the system state. So it's up
to developer to check, whether the requested object is really
set up, or not yet.

The latter, IPDB, is an asynchronously updated database, that
starts several additional threads by default. If your project's
policy doesn't allow implicit threads, keep it in mind. But
unlike IPRoute, the IPDB ensures the changes to be reflected
in the system::

    with IPDB() as ipdb:
        with ipdb.interfaces['eth0'] as i:
            i.up()
            i.add_ip('192.168.0.2/24')
            i.add_ip('192.168.0.3/24')
        # ---> <--- here you can expect `eth0` is up
        #           and has these two addresses, so
        #           the following code can rely on that

So IPDB is updated asynchronously, but the `commit()` operation
is synchronous.

NB: *In the example above `commit()` is implied with the
`__exit__()` of the `with` statement.*

The choice between IPDB and IPRoute depends on your project's
workflow. If you plan to retrieve the system info not too often
(or even once), or you are sure there will be not too many
network object, it is better to use IPRoute. If you plan to
lookup the network info on the regular basis and there can be
loads of network objects, it is better to use IPDB. Why?

IPRoute just loads what you ask -- and loads all the information
you ask to. While IPDB loads all the info upon startup, and
later is just updated by asynchronous broadcast netlink messages.
Assume you want to lookup ARP cache that contains hundreds or
even thousands of objects. Using IPRoute, you have to load all
the ARP cache every time you want to make a lookup. While IPDB
will load all the cache once, and then maintain it up-to-date
just inserting new records or removing them by one.

So, IPRoute is much simpler when you need to make a call and
then exit, while IPDB is cheaper in terms of CPU performance
if you implement a long-running program like a daemon.

Quickstart
----------

Simple tutorial::

    from pyroute2 import IPDB
    # several IPDB instances are supported within on process
    ipdb = IPDB()

    # commit is called automatically upon the exit from `with`
    # statement
    with ipdb.interfaces.eth0 as i:
        i.address = '00:11:22:33:44:55'
        i.ifname = 'bala'
        i.txqlen = 2000

    # basic routing support
    ipdb.routes.add({'dst': 'default',
                     'gateway': '10.0.0.1'}).commit()

    # do not forget to shutdown IPDB
    ipdb.release()

Please, notice `ip.release()` call in the end. Though it is
not forced in an interactive python session for the better
user experience, it is required in the scripts to sync the
IPDB state before exit.

IPDB supports functional-like syntax also::

    from pyroute2 import IPDB
    with IPDB() as ipdb:
        intf = (ipdb.interfaces['eth0']
                .add_ip('10.0.0.2/24')
                .add_ip('10.0.0.3/24')
                .set_address('00:11:22:33:44:55')
                .set_mtu(1460)
                .set_name('external')
                .commit())
        # ---> <--- here you have the interface reference with
        #           all the changes applied: renamed, added ipaddr,
        #           changed macaddr and mtu.
        ...  # some code

    # pls notice, that the interface reference will not work
    # outside of `with IPDB() ...`

Transaction modes
-----------------
IPDB has several operating modes:

    - 'implicit' (default) -- the first change starts an implicit
        transaction, that have to be committed
    - 'explicit' -- you have to begin() a transaction prior to
        make any change

The default is to use implicit transaction. This behaviour can
be changed in the future, so use 'mode' argument when creating
IPDB instances.

The sample session with explicit transactions::

    In [1]: from pyroute2 import IPDB
    In [2]: ip = IPDB(mode='explicit')
    In [3]: ifdb = ip.interfaces
    In [4]: ifdb.tap0.begin()
        Out[3]: UUID('7a637a44-8935-4395-b5e7-0ce40d31d937')
    In [5]: ifdb.tap0.up()
    In [6]: ifdb.tap0.address = '00:11:22:33:44:55'
    In [7]: ifdb.tap0.add_ip('10.0.0.1', 24)
    In [8]: ifdb.tap0.add_ip('10.0.0.2', 24)
    In [9]: ifdb.tap0.review()
        Out[8]:
        {'+ipaddr': set([('10.0.0.2', 24), ('10.0.0.1', 24)]),
         '-ipaddr': set([]),
         'address': '00:11:22:33:44:55',
         'flags': 4099}
    In [10]: ifdb.tap0.commit()


Note, that you can `review()` the `current_tx` transaction, and
`commit()` or `drop()` it. Also, multiple transactions are
supported, use uuid returned by `begin()` to identify them.

Actually, the form like 'ip.tap0.address' is an eye-candy. The
IPDB objects are dictionaries, so you can write the code above
as that::

    ipdb.interfaces['tap0'].down()
    ipdb.interfaces['tap0']['address'] = '00:11:22:33:44:55'
    ...

Context managers
----------------

Transactional objects (interfaces, routes) can act as context
managers in the same way as IPDB does itself::

    with ipdb.interfaces.tap0 as i:
        i.address = '00:11:22:33:44:55'
        i.ifname = 'vpn'
        i.add_ip('10.0.0.1', 24)
        i.add_ip('10.0.0.1', 24)

On exit, the context manager will authomatically `commit()` the
transaction.

Create interfaces
-----------------

IPDB can also create virtual interfaces::

    with ipdb.create(kind='bridge', ifname='control') as i:
        i.add_port(ip.interfaces.eth1)
        i.add_port(ip.interfaces.eth2)
        i.add_ip('10.0.0.1/24')


The `IPDB.create()` call has the same syntax as `IPRoute.link('add', ...)`,
except you shouldn't specify the `'add'` command. Refer to `IPRoute` docs
for details.

Routing management
------------------

IPDB has a simple yet useful routing management interface.
To add a route, there is an easy to use syntax::

    # spec as a dictionary
    spec = {'dst': '172.16.1.0/24',
            'oif': 4,
            'gateway': '192.168.122.60',
            'metrics': {'mtu': 1400,
                        'advmss': 500}}

    # pass spec as is
    ipdb.routes.add(spec).commit()

    # pass spec as kwargs
    ipdb.routes.add(**spec).commit()

    # use keyword arguments explicitly
    ipdb.routes.add(dst='172.16.1.0/24', oif=4, ...).commit()

To access and change the routes, one can use notations as follows::

    # default table (254)
    #
    # change the route gateway and mtu
    #
    with ipdb.routes['172.16.1.0/24'] as route:
        route.gateway = '192.168.122.60'
        route.metrics.mtu = 1500

    # access the default route
    print(ipdb.routes['default])

    # change the default gateway
    with ipdb.routes['default'] as route:
        route.gateway = '10.0.0.1'

    # list automatic routes keys
    print(ipdb.routes.tables[255].keys())

**Route specs**

It is important to understand, that routing tables in IPDB
are lists, not dicts. It is still possible to use a dict syntax
to retrieve records, but under the hood the tables are lists.

To retrieve or create routes one should use route specs. The
simplest case is to retrieve one route::

    # get route by prefix
    ipdb.routes['172.16.1.0/24']

    # get route by a special name
    ipdb.routes['default']

If there are more than one route that matches the spec, only
the first one will be retrieved. One should iterate all the
records and filter by a key to retrieve all matches::

    # only one route will be retrieved
    ipdb.routes['fe80::/64']

    # get all routes by this prefix
    [ x for x in ipdb.routes if x['dst'] == 'fe80::/64' ]

It is possible to use dicts as specs::

    ipdb.routes[{'dst': '172.16.0.0/16',
                 'oif': 2}]

The dict is just the same as a route representation in the
records list.

**Route metrics**

A special object is dedicated to route metrics, one can access it
via `route.metrics` or `route['metrics']`::

    # these two statements are equal:
    with ipdb.routes['172.16.1.0/24'] as route:
        route['metrics']['mtu'] = 1400

    with ipdb.routes['172.16.1.0/24'] as route:
        route.metrics.mtu = 1400

Possible metrics are defined in `rtmsg.py:rtmsg.metrics`, e.g.
`RTAX_HOPLIMIT` means `hoplimit` metric etc.

**Multipath routing**

Multipath nexthops are managed via `route.add_nh()` and `route.del_nh()`
methods. They are available to review via `route.multipath`, but one
should not directly add/remove/modify nexthops in `route.multipath`, as
the changes will not be committed correctly.

To create a multipath route::

    ip.routes.add({'dst': '172.16.232.0/24',
                   'multipath': [{'gateway': '172.16.231.2',
                                  'hops': 2},
                                 {'gateway': '172.16.231.3',
                                  'hops': 1},
                                 {'gateway': '172.16.231.4'}]}).commit()

To change a multipath route::

    with ip.routes['172.16.232.0/24'] as r:
        r.add_nh({'gateway': '172.16.231.5'})
        r.del_nh({'gateway': '172.16.231.4'})

**On multipath hops**

The `iproute2` tool uses `weigth` instead of `hops`. The weight
is number of hops + 1, so when one creates a nexthop with `hops == 2`,
the `iproute2` utility will show `weight 3`.

But the Linux kernel uses `rtnh_hops`, and the `pyroute2` library
places here no implications, directly mapping the value provided by the
kernel.

**Multipath default routes**

Deprecation notice: *As of the merge of kill_rtcache into the kernel,
and it's release in ~3.6, weighted default routes no longer work in
Linux*.

https://github.com/svinota/pyroute2/issues/171#issuecomment-149297244
for details.

Performance issues
------------------

In the case of bursts of Netlink broadcast messages, all
the activity of the pyroute2-based code in the async mode
becomes suppressed to leave more CPU resources to the
packet reader thread. So please be ready to cope with
delays in the case of Netlink broadcast storms. It means
also, that IPDB state will be synchronized with OS also
after some delay.

    def register_callback(self, callback, mode='post'):
        '''
        IPDB callbacks are routines executed on a RT netlink
        message arrival. There are two types of callbacks:
        "post" and "pre" callbacks.

        ...

        "Post" callbacks are executed after the message is
        processed by IPDB and all corresponding objects are
        created or deleted. Using ipdb reference in "post"
        callbacks you will access the most up-to-date state
        of the IP database.

        "Post" callbacks are executed asynchronously in
        separate threads. These threads can work as long
        as you want them to. Callback threads are joined
        occasionally, so for a short time there can exist
        stopped threads.

        ...

        "Pre" callbacks are synchronous routines, executed
        before the message gets processed by IPDB. It gives
        you the way to patch arriving messages, but also
        places a restriction: until the callback exits, the
        main event IPDB loop is blocked.

        Normally, only "post" callbacks are required. But in
        some specific cases "pre" also can be useful.

        ...

        The routine, `register_callback()`, takes two arguments:
            - callback function
            - mode (optional, default="post")

        The callback should be a routine, that accepts three
        arguments::

            cb(ipdb, msg, action)

        Arguments are:

            - **ipdb** is a reference to IPDB instance, that invokes
                the callback.
            - **msg** is a message arrived
            - **action** is just a msg['event'] field

        E.g., to work on a new interface, you should catch
        action == 'RTM_NEWLINK' and with the interface index
        (arrived in msg['index']) get it from IPDB::

            index = msg['index']
            interface = ipdb.interfaces[index]
