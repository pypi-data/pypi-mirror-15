Description: Bonafide
        ========
        Bonafide is the protocol for secure user registration, authentication, and provider discovery for the LEAP
        applications. See the `Bonafide`_ design docs.
        
        This is a client implementation, written in python. It consists of a python library, a
        twisted service and a command-line interface to interact locally with it.

        This is still in development. To play with it, create a virtualenv, and deploy
        the package in development mode by running::
        
          python setup.py develop
        
        from the parent folder.
        
        To run the bonafide service, you can use the bitmask.core daemon. From an
        environment in which you have installed the bitmask_core repo::
        
          bitmaskd
        
        Then you can use `bitmask_cli` to see the available actions, under the user
        command.
