Description: Eve-Swagger
        ===========
        
        Swagger_ extension for Eve_ powered RESTful APIs.
        
        Usage
        -----
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from eve import Eve
            from eve_swagger import swagger
        
            app = Eve()
            app.register_blueprint(swagger)
        
            # required. See http://swagger.io/specification/#infoObject for details.
            app.config['SWAGGER_INFO'] = {
                'title': 'My Supercool API',
                'version': '1.0',
                'description': 'an API description',
                'termsOfService': 'my terms of service',
                'contact': {
                    'name': 'nicola',
                    'url': 'http://nicolaiarocci.com'
                },
                'license': {
                    'name': 'BSD',
                    'url': 'https://github.com/nicolaiarocci/eve-swagger/blob/master/LICENSE',
                }
            },
        
            # optional. Will use flask.request.host if missing.
            app.config['SWAGGER_HOST'] = 'myhost.com'
        
            if __name__ == '__main__':
                app.run()
        
        When API is up and running, visit the ``/api-docs`` endpoint. The resulting
        JSON can then be used with swagger tooling, like the Swagger Editor:
        
        .. image:: resources/swagger_editor.png
        
        Installation
        ------------
        .. code-block::
        
            $ pip install eve-swagger
