        SoMaJo
        ======
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        SoMaJo is a state-of-the-art tokenizer for German web and social media
        texts that won the `EmpiriST 2015 shared task
        <https://sites.google.com/site/empirist2015/>`_ on automatic
        linguistic annotation of computer-mediated communication / social
        media. As such, it is particularly well-suited to perform tokenization
        on all kinds of written discourse, for example chats, forums, wiki
        talk pages, tweets, blog comments, social networks, SMS and WhatsApp
        dialogues.
        
        The system is described in greater detail in Proisl and Uhrig (2016).
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        SoMaJo can be easily installed using pip::
        
          pip install SoMaJo
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Using the tokenizer executable
        ------------------------------
        
        You can use the tokenizer as a standalone program from the command
        line. General usage information is available via the ``-h`` option::
          
          tokenizer -h
        
        To tokenize a text file according to the guidelines of the EmpiriST
        2015 shared task, just call the tokenizer like this::
          
          tokenizer -c <file>
        
        If you do not want to split camel-cased tokens, simply drop the ``-c``
        option::
          
          tokenizer <file>
        
        Using the module
        ----------------
        
        You can easily incorporate the tokenizer into your own Python
        projects. All you have to do is import ``somajo.Tokenizer``, create a
        ``Tokenizer`` object and call its ``tokenize`` method::
        
          from somajo import Tokenizer
          
          tokenizer = Tokenizer(split_camel_case=True)
          tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(paragraph)
        
        Evaluation
        ==========
        
        SoMaJo was the system with the highest average F₁ score in the
        EmpiriST 2015 shared task. The performance of the current version on
        the two test sets is summarized in the following table\ [1]_:
