lightct is a python package for visual light computed tomography. With just a webcam and a rotating stage the package will allow for the acquisition of 2D projections and the reconstruction of objects in 3D.

This package will be showcased at the Royal Society Summer Exhibition (4th - 10th July 2016), allowing members of the public to run their own synchrotron style experiment:
