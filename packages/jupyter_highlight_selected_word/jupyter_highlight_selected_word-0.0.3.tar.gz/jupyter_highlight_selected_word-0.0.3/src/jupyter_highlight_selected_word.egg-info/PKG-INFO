Description: 
                Jupyter notebook extension that enables the CodeMirror addon "Match
                Highlighter" (see https://codemirror.net/demo/matchhighlighter.html),
                which highlights all instances of the selected word in the current

                There are a few configurable options, all of which sit under the config
