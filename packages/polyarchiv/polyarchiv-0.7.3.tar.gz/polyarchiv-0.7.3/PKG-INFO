Description: Polyarchiv
        ==========
        
        Backup data from multiple local sources (organized in local repositories) and send them to one or more remote repositories.
        Configuration is based on simple `.ini` files: 
            
          * `my-local-repo.local` defines a local repository named `my-local-repo`,
          * `my-remote-repo.remote` defines a remote repository named `my-remote-repo`.
          
        Each local repository defines one or more data sources, all of them being defined in the `my-local-repo.local` file:
        
          * directory with files,
          * MySQL or PostgreSQL database to dump,
          * OpenLDAP database to dump.
        
        There are several kinds of local repositories:
        
          * raw files,
          * local git repository: after each backup, files that have been gathered from the different sources are added and locally commited.
          
        There are also several kinds of remote repositories:
        
          * GitRepository (requires a local git repository): after the backup, local commits are pushed to this remote git repository,
          * Rsync: after the backup, all files are synchronized to the remote repository,
          * TarArchive: after the backup, all files are archived in a single .tar.gz archive and sent to the remote repo (via ftp, scp, http, smb, or a basic cp),
          * Duplicity: after the backup, all files are encrypted and sent to the remote repository.
        
        Each repository (either local or remote) is associated to a backup frequency. 
        If a given repository has a daily backup frequency but you execute Polyarchiv twice a day, only the first backup will be executed. 
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The simplest way is to use `pip`:
        
            $ pip install polyarchiv
        
        Some commands are available:
        display the current configuration, local and remote repositories, sources and backup status
        
            $ polyarchiv config [-C /my/config/dir] [--verbose]
        
        backup data. If you set a frequency, repositories that are not out-of-date are not run (unless you specified `--force`)
        
            $ polyarchiv backup [-C /my/config/dir] [--force]
         
        display all available engines (and their options if you specified `--verbose`)
        
            $ polyarchiv plugins [--verbose]
        
        You can also generate a Debian/Ubuntu package with: 
        
            sudo apt-get install python-stdeb
            python setup.py --command-packages=stdeb.command  bdist_deb
            
        Next steps
        ----------
        
          * run `polyarchiv plugins -v` to check available sources and repositories
          * create config files for your local repositories (you should organize all your backups in several local repository, maybe one per service)
          * create config files for your remote servers (one config file per server)
          * run `polyarchiv config -v` to check your configuration
          * run `polyarchiv backup --dry --show-commands --force` to check the executed script
          * run `polyarchiv backup` in a crontab :-)
            
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        The default configuration directory is `/etc/polyarchiv` unless you installed it in a virtualenv, 
        (then its default config dir is `$VIRTUALENV/etc/polyarchiv`). 
        Otherwise, you can specify another config dir with `polyarchiv -C /my/config/dir`.
        
        This directory should contain configuration files for local repositories 
        (like `my-local.local`) as well as remote repositories (like `my-remote.remote`).
        
        Here is an example of local repository, gathering data from three sources:
        
          * PostgresSQL database
          * MySQL database
          * a directory
        
        Its name must end by `.local`. 
        The `[global]` section defines options for the local repository (the engine that powers the local backup, the frequency, â€¦), and other sections define the three sources:
        
            $ cat /etc/polyarchiv/my-local.local
            [global]
            engine=git
            local_path=/tmp/local
            local_tags=local
            included_remote_tags=*
            excluded_remote_tags=
            frequency=daily
            
            [source_1]
            engine=postgressql
            host=localhost
            port=5432
            user=test
            password=testtest
            database=testdb
            destination_path=./postgres.sql
            
            [source_2]
            engine=mysql
            host=localhost
            port=3306
            user=test
            password=testtest
            database=testdb
            destination_path=./mysql.sql
            
            [source_3]
            engine=rsync
            source_path=/tmp/source/files
            destination_path=./files
        
        The kind of repository (either local or remote) and of each source is defined by the "engine" option.
        You can define as many local repositories (each of them with one or more sources) as you want.
        Remote repositories are simpler and only have a `[global]` section.
        Their names must end by `.remote`.
        Here is a gitlab acting as remote storage for git local repo: 
        
            $ cat /etc/polyarchiv/my-remote1.remote
            [global]
            engine=git
            frequency=daily
            remote_tags=
            remote_url=http://gitlab.example.org/group/TestsPolyarchiv.git
            remote_branch=master
            user=mgallet
            included_local_tags=*
        
        Maybe you also want a full backup (as an archive) uploaded monthly (the tenth day of each month) to a FTP server:
        
            $ cat /etc/polyarchiv/my-remote2.remote
            [global]
            engine=tar
            frequency=monthly:10
            remote_tags=
            remote_url=ftp://myftp.example.org/backups/project/
            remote_branch=master
            user=mgallet
            password=p@ssw0rd
            tar_format=tar.xz
            included_local_tags=*
        
        Configuration files can be owned by different users: files that are unreadable by the current user are ignored.
        
        Available engines
        -----------------
        
        Several engines for sources and remote or local repositories are available.
        Use `polyarchiv plugins` to display the full list, and `polyarchiv plugins -v` to display all their configuration options.
         
        Extra backup options
        --------------------
        
          * `--verbose`: display more infos
          * `--force`: force the backup, even if not required (the last backup is recent enough)
          * `--nrpe`: the output is compatible with Nagios/NRPE (so you can use it like a standard Nagios check in your sup)
          * `--show-commands`: display all operations as a plain Bash script
          * `--confirm-commands`: display all operations and ask for a manual confirmation before running them
          * `--dry`: does not actually perform operations
          * `--only-locals`: limit used local repositories to these tags
          * `--only-remotes`: limit used remote repositories to these tags
        
        Associating local and remote repositories
        -----------------------------------------
        
        All remote repositories apply to all local repositories but you can change this behaviour by applying tags to repositories.
        By default, a local repository has the tag `local` and include all remote repositories `included_remote_tags=*`.
        A remote repository has the tag `remote` and include all local repositories `included_local_tags=*`.
        
        If large local repositories should not be sent to a given remote repository, you can exclude the "large" tags from the remote configuration:
         
            $ cat /etc/polyarchiv/my-remote.remote
            [global]
            engine=git
            excluded_local_tags=*large,huge
        
        and add the "large" tag in the local configuration:
        
            $ cat /etc/polyarchiv/my-local.local
            [global]
            engine=git
            local_path=/tmp/local
            local_tags=local,large
        
        Traditionnal shell expansion is used for comparing included and excluded tags. Tags can be applied to remote repositories:
        
            $ cat /etc/polyarchiv/my-remote.remote
            [global]
            engine=git
            remote_tags=small-only
        
        and add the "large" tag to the local configuration:
        
            $ cat /etc/polyarchiv/my-local.local
            [global]
            engine=git
            local_path=/tmp/local
            included_remote_tags=huge,large
            
        Since the remote repository does not present either the `huge` tag or the `large` tag, it will not be applied.
