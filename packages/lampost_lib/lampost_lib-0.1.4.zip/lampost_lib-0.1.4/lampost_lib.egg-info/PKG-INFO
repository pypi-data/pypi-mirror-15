Description: Lampost Library
        ---------------
        
        A framework library initially developed to support the Lampost Mud.
        Current components include:
        
        lampost.db
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        A JSON based fast and efficient storage mechanism for Python objects and
        their relationships. Persisted fields are identified by descriptor
        classes. Full inheritance (including "mixins") is supported. Default
        values (including empty collections) are not persisted to improve
        storage usage and network efficiency.
