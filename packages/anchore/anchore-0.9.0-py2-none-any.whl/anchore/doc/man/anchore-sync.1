.TH ANCHORE, "1" "June 2016" "anchore, version 0.9.0" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
anchore, \- manual page for anchore, version 0.9.0
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B anchore
\fIsync \fR[\fIOPTIONS\fR] \fICOMMAND \fR[\fIARGS\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IP
Manage synchronization activities of the local anchore instance with the
anchore service. The primary operation is the catalog sync, which
downloads metadata from the anchore web service and pulls the subscribed
images from dockerhub.com.
.IP
user\-image sync manages the execution of user\-supplied scripts to fetch
images for local analysis.
.IP
There are two basic kinds of syncs: catalog syncs and user\-image syncs.
.IP
A catalog sync pulls down the latest metadata from the anchore web service
as well as any images from Docker Hub as specified in the current
subscriptions list. See anchore\-subscriptions(1) for commands to manage
the current set of subscribed containers.
.IP
An initial catalog sync is the first command required to initialize the
system upon installation. Until a catalog sync has occured, the local
system has no information about what subscriptions are available from the
web service.
.IP
Requiring explicit sync invocation is by design so that all of the anchore
tools can run without connecting to the Anchore web service once a sync
has been completed to enable the administrator to explicitly control when
network access is needed and used.
