.SH NAME
anchore, \- manual page for anchore, version 0.9.0
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B anchore
\fIsystem restore \fR[\fIOPTIONS\fR] \fIINPUTFILE \fR[\fIDESTINATION_ROOT\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IP
Restore anchore from a backup to directory root. E.g. "anchore system
restore \fI/tmp/anchore_backup.tar.gz\fP /"
.IP
If the image_data_store value has been changed from default ('data') to a
path outside of the anchore_data_dir subtree then manual intervention may
be required to modify the restored config file or move the
image_data_store if relative paths were used that are no longer
accessible. The restore process is an untar process so data is placed in
the same place relative to the root directory when the tar was created. If
the system being restored on is structured differently than the original
backup source then manual movement of data or config file values may be
necessary to get all artifacts in the correct locations for the system to
find.
