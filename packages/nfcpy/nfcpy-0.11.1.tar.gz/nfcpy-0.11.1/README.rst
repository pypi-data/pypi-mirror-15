The **nfcpy** module implements `NFC Forum`_ specifications for
wireless short-range data exchange with NFC devices and tags. It is
written in `Python`_ and aims to provide an easy-to-use yet powerful
framework for applications integrating NFC. The source code is
licensed under the `EUPL`_ and hosted at `GitHub`_. Release versions
are published on `PyPI`_ for ``pip install -U nfcpy``. Documentation
for latest development and active release versions can be found on
`Read the Docs`_. The `issues`_ tracker is the place for `bugs`_ and 
`questions`_ (also check the old `Launchpad`_ project site for 
`answers`_).
