Affiliate system for django
===========================

|Build Status| |Coverage Status| |Pypi version|

Affiliate system to reward partners with their visitors payments.
Contains abstract models with basic functionality, so it is easy to
subclass them and add your custom logic and relations.

**Note**: version 0.2.0 is backwards incompatible with previous
versions.

Example
-------

Visitor goes to site with affiliate code:

::

    http://site.com/?aid=12345

This code is saved in his cookies (also another way is supported: keep
aid=12345 at every url). Now each request object has property
``request.affiliate``, so you can access to affiliate, that attract
current visitor, and therefore reward him at needed event.

Property ``request.affiliate`` is lazy. To check, that affiliate exist,
do this:

::

        if request.affiliate.exists():
            # optionally check, that he is active:
            if request.affiliate.is_active:
                # request comes from affiliate with code 
                # affiliate.aid

You can find example project in this repository.

Used by projects
----------------

-  `builds.io <http://builds.io/>`__
-  `wirelayer.net <http://www.wirelayer.net/>`__
-  `smmplanner.com <https://smmplanner.com/>`__

Requirements
------------

-  python (2.7, 3.4, 3.5)
-  django (1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9)

Quick start
-----------

1. Install this package to your python distribution

   ::

       pip install django-affiliate

2. Add 'affiliate' to INSTALLED\_APP:

   ::

       INSTALLED_APPS = [
           # ...
           'affiliate',
       ]

3. Add 'affiliate.middleware.AffiliateMiddleware' to
   MIDDLEWARE\_CLASSES:

   ::

       MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
           # ...
           'affiliate.middleware.AffiliateMiddleware',
       )

4. Define your custom affiliate model (similar to custom user model):

   ::

       # our_app/models.py
       from django.db import models
       from affiliate.models import AbstractAffiliate


       class Affiliate(AbstractAffiliate):
           pass  # or add some your custom fields here

       # settngs.py
       AFFILIATE_AFFILIATE_MODEL = 'our_app.Affiliate'

5. Create tables

   ::

       # django <= 1.6
       python manage.py syncdb

       # django <= 1.6 & south
       python manage.py schemamigration our_app --auto
       python manage.py migrate our_app

       # django >= 1.7
       python manage.py makemigrations our_app
       python manage.py migrate our_app

6. Finally, reward affiliate

   ::

       from django.views.generic import FormView
       from affiliate.tools import get_affiliate_model

       Affiliate = get_affiliate_model()

       class SomeView(FormView):
           # ...

           def form_valid(self.form):
               product = self.get_product()
               if self.request.affiliate.exists() and self.request.affiliate.is_active:
                   # reward affiliate here, your custom logic is here
                   Transaction.objects.create(
                       user=self.affiliate.user,
                       amount=Affiliate.calc_affiliate_reward(product.price))
                   return super(SomeView, self).form_valid(form)

Optional
^^^^^^^^

To always keep the aid GET parameter (maybe you don't trust the cookies
or you want to reward affiliate only if his visitor make payment at
current link access, and not tomorrow)

1. Load 'affiliate\_urls' tags:

   ::

       {% load affiliate_urls %}

2. Use 'url\_aff' instead of 'url' template tag:

   ::

       <a href="{% url_aff 'home' %}">Home</a>

Configuration
-------------

Define in settings.py

-  AFFILIATE\_AFFILIATE\_MODEL - the model to use to represent an
   Affiliate, similar to
   `AUTH\_USER\_MODEL <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#std:setting-AUTH_USER_MODEL>`__.
   Mandatory, must be explicitly defined.
-  AFFILIATE\_PARAM\_NAME - name of affiliate GET parameter in url.
   Default ``'aid'``.
-  AFFILIATE\_REWARD\_AMOUNT - default affiliate reward amount. Can be
   set as string (``'5.55'``) or as int (``10``). Default ``10``.
-  AFFILIATE\_REWARD\_PERCENTAGE - if True, ``AFFILIATE_REWARD_AMOUNT``
   is treated as percentage. Otherwise as exact amount of money. Default
   ``True``.
-  AFFILIATE\_SAVE\_IN\_SESSION - save affiliate id in session or not.
   Default ``True``.
-  AFFILIATE\_SESSION\_AGE - how long keep affiliate id in session, in
   seconds. Default ``5 * 24 * 60 * 60`` seconds (5 days).
-  AFFILIATE\_DEFAULT\_LINK - default link, that will be used by
   ``Affiliate.build_absolute_affiliate_uri`` and
   ``.build_affiliate_url``. Default ``'/'``.
-  AFFILIATE\_REMOVE\_PARAM\_AND\_REDIRECT - if True, remove affiliate
   param from url and redirect to same url (affiliate data will be saved
   in session). Default ``False``.
