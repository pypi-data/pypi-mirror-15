Invenio module for OAI-PMH metadata harvesting between repositories.

* Free software: GPLv2 license
* Documentation: https://pythonhosted.org/invenio-oaiharvester/

*This is an experimental development preview release.*

About
=====

This module allows you to easily harvest OAI-PMH repositories, thanks to the `Sickle`_ module, and via signals
you can hook the output into your application, or simply to files.

You keep configurations of your OAI-PMH sources via SQLAlchemy models and run or schedule immediate harvesting jobs
via command-line or regularly via `Celery beat`_.
