   3,000,000 words and phrases mapped by word2vec using Google News into 300
   dimensions. The data was then embedded into 2 dimensions using Spectral
   Embedding. The plot shows a sample of 10,000 points displaying the overall
   shape of the embedding as well as the estimated "stretch" 
   (i.e. dual push-forward Riemannian metric) at various locations in the embedding.
