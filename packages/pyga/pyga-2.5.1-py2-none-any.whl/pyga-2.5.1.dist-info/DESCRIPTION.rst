pyga is an iplementation of Google Analytics (ga.js) in Python;so that it can be used at server side.
This project only helps you with Data Collection part of Google Analytics.
ie., You can consider this as a replacement for ga.js at client side.

Google Provides Android SDK,iOS SDK + Flash SDK. 
And left everybody else with a single page documentation about GIF request parameters. 
Also with a basic sample of server side implementation in quite a few languages (perl, php, jsp).

PS: google moved away from ga.js to analytics.js; a new operating standard for Google Analytics named "universal analytics".
Soon ga.js will be deprectaed. I'm planning to have a pyga equivalent to the new standard. Read more here at
