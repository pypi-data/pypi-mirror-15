        Python (3) library that helps you connect to Amazon's
        `IVONA <https://www.ivona.com/>`__ Speech Cloud from within your Python
        project. You need its `access
        keys <http://developer.ivona.com/en/speechcloud/introduction.html#Credentials>`__
        to use it.
        
        It currently only implements ``CreateSpeech`` and ``ListVoices``
        endpoints, as they should cover the vast majority of use cases. Lexicons
        endpoints may be added in the future.
        
        If you're looking for out-of-the-box solution, have a look at
        `ivona-speak <https://github.com/Pythonity/ivona-speak>`__ - it's a
        script that uses this very library and lets you use its functionality
        directly from your shell.
        
        Packages required for running and testing are listed in ``requirements``
        directory.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        With ``pip``:
        
        ::
        
            $ pip3 install ivona_api
        
        API
        ---
        
        There's no documentation as of now, but the code is commented and
        *should* be pretty straightforward to use.
        
        But feel free to ask `me <mailto:pawel.adamczak@sidnet.info>`__ if
        anything is unclear.
        
        Tests
        -----
        
        Package was tested with ``pytest`` and ``tox`` on Python 3.4 (see
        ``tox.ini``).
        
        To run tests yourself you need to set environment variables with secret
        and access keys before running ``tox`` inside the repository:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            export IVONA_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_ACCESS_KEY"
            export IVONA_SECRET_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_SECRET_KEY"
