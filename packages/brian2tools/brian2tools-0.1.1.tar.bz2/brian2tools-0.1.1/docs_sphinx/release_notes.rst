Release notes
=============

brian2tools 0.1
---------------
This is the first release of the `brian2tools` package (a collection of optional tools for the
`Brian 2 simulator <http://briansimulator.org>`), providing several plotting functions to plot model properties
(such as synapses or morphologies) and simulation results (such as raster plots or voltage traces). It also introduces
a convenience function `~brian2tools.plotting.base.brian_plot` which takes a Brian 2 object as an argument and produces
a plot based on it. See :doc:`user/plotting` for details.
