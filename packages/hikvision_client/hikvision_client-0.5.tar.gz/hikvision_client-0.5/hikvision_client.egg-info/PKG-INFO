Description: Hikvision Client
        ================
        
        This is a graphical client for use with Hikvision DVR systems which
        support RTSP.
        
        The Program reads a config file from ~/.hikvision-client/cam\_config,
        which defines which cameras the program can access.
        
        Afterwards, the user is prompted for a username and password, which is
        then used to authenticate the connection to the Hikvision DVR
        
        The program has been tested with the Hikvision DS-8016HFI-ST, it should
        however be able to connect to other RTSP-enabled DVRs as well. Or any
        RTSP feed in general.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install the program, either download the source and run
        
        ::
        
            # python setup.py install
        
        or, if you have pip installed, run
        
        ::
        
            # pip install hikvision_client
        
        This should also install all python dependencies required by the program
        
        The program makes use of the VLC Media Player, and as such it is
        required for VLC to be installed for this program to function correctly.
        
        Writing the Config File
        -----------------------
        
        The program requires a configuration file located at
        ~/.hikvision-client/cam\_config. It is a plain text file. To add a
        camera, add a new line in the following format:
        
        #####
        
        The camera link is formatted like this:
        
        ::
        
            <domain>/h264/chX/main/av_stream  (analog)
            <domain>/Streaming/Channels/X01   (digital)
        
        whereas 'X' is the channel number of the camera.
