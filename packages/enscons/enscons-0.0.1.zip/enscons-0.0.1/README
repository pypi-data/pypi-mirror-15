enscons
=======

An experimental Python packaging system using SCons.

This is intended to be the shortest possible code to build
pip compatible wheels and sdists with SCons. Rather than adding
build features to a Python packaging system, enscons adds Python
packaging to a general purpose build system.

using enscons
=============

Copy enscons' pyproject.toml, SConstruct, and setup.py into your
own project.

Edit pyproject.toml with your own setup.py-style arguments. Enscons
only uses those arguments that affect the static metadata, PKG-INFO
or METADATA, and not build-related arguments such as C extensions.

Recognized arguments: name, version, description, description_file,
url, author, author_email, license, keywords, platform, classifiers,
install_requires, extras_require

Run scons or 'python setup.py' to build all targets.

Why SCons?
==========

SCons is a general purpose build system. It is pure Python, and it
is on the cusp of becoming Python 3 compatible. These features make
it a good candidate for an experimental Python packaging system.
