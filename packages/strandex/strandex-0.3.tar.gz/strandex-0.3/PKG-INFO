Description: # strandex
        **strand**-anchored reg**ex** for uniform sampling from FASTQ files (think **spandex**)
        
        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mdshw5/strandex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mdshw5/strandex)
        
        ##Why use this?
        - You want only a few reads from a large FASTQ file (**downsampling**)
        - You are constrained by I/O so that reading through the entire file is very slow
        - You want to avoid sampling only the beginning or end of the file
        - You want to expand a small FASTQ file to a specific number of reads (**upsampling**)
        
        # Install
        
        `pip install strandex`
        
        # Examples
        
        ```
        from strandex import FastqSampler
        
        sampler = FastqSampler('read1.fastq', fastq2='read2.fastq', nreads=100000, seed=42)
        for read1, read2 in sampler:
          # read1 and read2 are 4-line strings sampled from paired input
        
        sampler = FastqSampler('read1.fastq', nreads=100000, seed=42)
          for read1, read2 in sampler:
            # read1 is a 4-line string sampled from input
            # read2 is NoneType
        ```
        Note that you may sample more reads *than are available in your input file*. In
        the event that you want to sample more reads than your input file contains, strandex
        will sample the file with replacement, meaning you will get some duplicate reads.
        
        # CLI script
        
        ```
        usage: strandex [-h] [-fq2 FASTQ2] [-o2 OUT2] [-n NREADS] [-s SEED] fastq1 out
        
        sample uniformly without reading an entire fastq file
        
        positional arguments:
          fastq1                input fastq file
          out                   output fastq file
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          -fq2 FASTQ2, --fastq2 FASTQ2
                                input fastq file read pairs
          -o2 OUT2, --out2 OUT2
                                output fastq file read pairs
          -n NREADS, --nreads NREADS
                                number of reads to sample from input (default: 1)
          -s SEED, --seed SEED  seed for random number generator (default: None)
        ```
