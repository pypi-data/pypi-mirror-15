Description: ======================
        Chkopy (checksum Copy)
        ======================
        
        Chkopy is a library of md5 checksum tools. This includes a basic md5 checksum generator and a recursive
        directory level md5 checksum tool. Standard install includes chkopy command line tool. This uses the 
        chkopy library to confirm that files copied from source to destination match one another.
        Because it can be called recursively (building a hash by walking a directory tree and assessing 
        chunks of files), it is the ideal tool for safely transferring large quantities of data. For users 
        who want to simply compare two files -n can be used to nullify the copying operation.
