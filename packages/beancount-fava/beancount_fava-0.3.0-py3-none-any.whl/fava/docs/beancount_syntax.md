title: Beancount Syntax
---

Below is a short reference of the Beancount Language Syntax. For the official,
full documentation see
[furius.ca/beancount/doc/syntax](http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/syntax).  There
is also an official [Syntax Cheat
Sheet](http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/cheatsheet).

## Introduction

Beancount defines a language in which financial transactions are entered into a
text-file (called input-file), which then can be processed by Beancount.  There
are a few building blocks that are important to understand Beancount's Syntax:

- Currencies (`USD`, `EUR`, ...) and values
- Accounts (`Assets:US:BofA:Checking`, ...)
- Directives (`open`, `balance`, ...)

## Commodities

All in CAPS: `USD`, `EUR`, `CAD`, `AUD` `GOOG`, `AAPL`, `RBF1005`, `HOME_MAYST`,
`AIRMILES`, `HOURS`.

## Account Types

Example Account Name: `Assets:US:BofA:Checking`

| Name          | Type | Contains                     | Examples                        | Option to change name                           |
|---------------|------|------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `Assets`      | +    | Cash, Checking-Account, etc. | `Assets:Checking`         | `option "name_assets" "Vermoegen"`              |
| `Liabilities` | -    | Credit Card, etc.            | `Liabilities:CreditCard`  | `option "name_liabilities" "Verbindlichkeiten"` |
| `Income`      | -    | Salary, etc.                 | `Income:EmployerA`        | `option "name_income" "Einkommen"`              |
| `Expenses`    | +    | Expense-Categories           | `Expenses:Fun:Cinema`     | `option "name_expenses" "Ausgaben"`             |
| `Equity`      | -    | Almost always auto-generated | `Equity:Opening-Balances` | `option "name_equity" "Eigenkapital"`           |


## Directives

The basic building block are **directives** (also called **entries**).  Most
directives start with a date, then the type of the directive, and then
directive-specific arguments. The ordering of directives in the input-file does
not matter, because Beancount orders them based on the date of each directive.

General syntax: `YYYY-MM-DD <directive> <arguments...>`

### Open and Close accounts

To open or close an account use the `open` and `close` directives:

```beancount
2015-05-29 open Expenses:Restaurant
2015-05-29 open Assets:Checking     USD,EUR  ; Currency constraints
; ...
2016-02-23 close Assets:Checking
```

### Commodities

Declaring commodities is optional. Use this if you want to attach metadata by currency.

```beancount
1998-07-22 commodity AAPL
  name: "Apple Computer Inc."
```

### Prices

You can use this directive to fill historical price database:

```beancount
2015-04-30 price AAPL   125.15 USD
2015-05-30 price AAPL   130.28 USD
```

### Notes

```beancount
2013-03-20 note Assets:Checking "Called to ask about rebate"
```

### Documents

```beancount
2013-03-20 document Assets:Checking "path/to/statement.pdf"
```

### Transactions

```beancount
2015-05-30 * "Some narration about this transaction"
  Liabilities:CreditCard   -101.23 USD
  Expenses:Restaurant       101.23 USD

2015-05-30 ! "Cable Co" "Phone Bill" #tag Ë†link
  id: "TW378743437"               ; Meta-data
  Expenses:Home:Phone  87.45 USD
  Assets:Checking                 ; You may leave one amount out
```

### Postings

```beancount
...    123.45 USD                             ; simple
...        10 GOOG {502.12 USD}               ; with cost
...   1000.00 USD   @ 1.10 CAD                ; with price
...        10 GOOG {502.12 USD} @ 1.10 CAD    ; with cost & price
...        10 GOOG {502.12 USD / 2014-05-12}  ; with date
! ...   123.45 USD ...                        ; with flag
```

### Balance Assertions and Padding

```beancount

```

Automatic insertion of transaction to fulfill the following assertion:

```beancount
