Description: nxppy
        =====
        
        nxppy is a *very* simple Python wrapper for interfacing with the
        excellent `NXP EXPLORE-NFC
        shield <http://uk.farnell.com/nxp-explore-nfc>`__ for the `Raspberry
        Pi <http://www.raspberrypi.org/>`__. It takes NXP's NFC Reader Library
        and provides a thin layer for detecting a Mifare NFC tag, reading its
        UID (unique identifier), and reading/writing data from/to the user area.

        External components
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        This work was based very heavily on NXP's MifareClassic example code.
        The example code was only reorganized to be more conducive as an
        interface. NXP still retains full copyright and ownership of the example
        code and the NFC Reader Library. The license conditions that need to be
        accepted in order to use this project in conjunction with the NFC Reader
        Library can be found in the document
        `NXP\_NFC\_Reader\_Library\_licencefile.pdf <https://github.com/Schoberm/nxppy/blob/master/NXP_NFC_Reader_Library_licencefile.pdf>`__
        
        Compatibility
        =============
        
        Tested with both Python 2.7 and 3.4 as installed on Raspian Jessie.
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        The EXPLORE-NFC card relies on SPI being enabled. Please enable SPI
        using raspi-config prior to installing nxppy.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        nxppy is available from PyPI. To install, simply run:
        
        ::
        
            sudo pip install nxppy
        
        Installation will take some time as it automatically pulls down the NXP
        NFC Reader Library from souce.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Currently, the module supports ISO14443-3A/4A cards only:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import nxppy
        
            mifare = nxppy.Mifare()
        
            # Select the first available tag and return the UID
            uid = mifare.select()
        
            # Read a single block of 4 bytes from block 10 
            block10bytes = mifare.read_block(10)
        
            # Write a single block of 4 bytes
            mifare.write_block(10, 'abcd')
        
        Example polling for tags:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import nxppy
            import time
        
            mifare = nxppy.Mifare()
        
            # Print card UIDs as they are detected
            while True:
                try:
                    uid = mifare.select()
                    print(uid)
                except nxppy.SelectError:
                    # SelectError is raised if no card is in the field.
                    pass
                    
                time.sleep(1)
        
        Feedback
        ========
        
        I welcome your feedback and pull requests! This project started as a
        necessity for my own Raspberry Pi development, but I'm hoping others
        will find it useful as a way to quickly bootstrap NFC-based projects.
        Enjoy!
