Description: MicroQueue is a Python module that allows you to use Redis as a message queue.
        The resulting message queues are compatible with those provided by the python
        hotqueue/redislite-hotqueue modules when used with the json serializer.  This code is written to work
        properly in conjunction with the micropython-redis module to allow operation on resource constrained
        embedded platforms.
