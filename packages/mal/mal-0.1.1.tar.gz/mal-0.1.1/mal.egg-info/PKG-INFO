Description: mal -- MyAnimeList Command Line Interface
        =========================================
        
        Description
        -----------
        
        ``mal`` is a command-line client for
        `MyAnimeList.net <http://myanimelist.net/>`__. It uses their official
        `API <http://myanimelist.net/modules.php?go=api>`__, so it should remain
        functional indefinitely (unlike screen-scraping alternatives). But is in
        alpha development yet, so new ideas is welcome! This version is a
        inspired tool from the slow-maintained
        `mal <https://github.com/pushrax/mal>`__.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        -  Python 3.0+
        -  `requests <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html>`__
        -  pypandoc (only for developing & PyPI submission)
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Download the package using ``git clone git@github.com:ryukinix/mal.git``
        or as ``zip`` file, so then:
        
        -  ``sudo python setup.py install``
        -  ``sudo make install`` (alternative)
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        First Steps
        -----------
        
        The program need your credentials to access your list. In the first
        call, the program will ask your ``username/password`` and SAVE IN PLAIN
        TEXT on the default\_path (generally ``~/.myanimelist.ini``):
        
        .. code:: ini
        
            [mal]
            username = your_username
            password = your_password
        
        Why save in plain text? Because the bad design of MAL API, maybe we can
        change this in future, but for now you can blame her. You also can call
        directly this function:
        
        -  ``mal login``

           :alt: login
        
           login
        
        Functionalities:
        ----------------
        
        -  Search in your anime list
        -  Search current anime in the sublist (e.g: watching)
        -  Increment/Decrement anime watching
        -  Score in final watching
        -  Fetch all anime list
        
        Search in your anime list
        -------------------------
        
        -  ``mal anime-by-regex``
        
        .. figure:: https://i.imgur.com/B8QNHzB.png
           :alt: search
        
           search
        
        Search current anime in the sublists:
        -------------------------------------
        
        -  ``mal watching``
        -  ``mal plan to watch``
        -  ``mal rewatching``
        -  ``mal on hold``
        -  ``mal dropped``

           filtering
        
        Increment/Decrement
        -------------------
        
        -  Increment/Decrement the number of episodes watched with
           ``mal [inc | dec] [regex]`` (you can swap the order too!). If there
           are multiple matches, it prompts you to select which one. If
           incrementing from ``0``, it sets the anime status to "watching" and
           sets the start date to today. If incrementing to the total episode
           count, it sets the anime status to "completed" and sets the end date
           to today.
        
        -  ``mal inc anime-regex`` ``mal anime-regex inc``
           ``mal +1 anime-regex`` ``mal anime-regex +1``
        
        -  ``mal dec anime-regex`` ``mal anime-regex dec``
           ``mal -1 anime-regex dec`` ``mal -1 anime-regex dec``
        
        .. figure:: https://i.imgur.com/9ZF17Lh.png
           :alt: inc-dec
        
           inc-dec
        
        List all animes:
        ================
        
        -  ``mal all``
        -  ``mal list``
        -  ``mal .+`` (is regex right? :D)
