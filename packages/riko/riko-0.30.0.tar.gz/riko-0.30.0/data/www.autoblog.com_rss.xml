<p>Thanks to the smoke wand in the wind tunnel, you can actually <em>see</em> the difference in our video.</p>
</blockquote>
Should you drive with your pickup truck's tailgate up or down? It's an age-old controversy that's divided drivers for decades. Traditionalists will swear you should leave the tailgate down. Makes sense, right? It would seem to let the air flow more cleanly over the body and through the bed. But there's also a school of thought that argues trucks are designed to look and operate in a specific manner, and modern design techniques can help channel the airflow properly. So don't mess with all of that: Leave the tailgate up.<br />
<br />
Which is true?<br />
<br />
To solve this tailgate debate, we went inside the wind tunnel at <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/ford/">Ford</a> to test the aerodynamics of the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/ford/f-150/">2015 Ford F-150</a>. The model's exterior design manager Brad Richards explained that the new truck was designed with purposeful edges and shapes that look imposing, yet still allow the F-150 to maintain strong aerodynamics. "We think this is the toughest F-150 by far, but also the most efficient," Richards said.<br />
<br />
All of this matters, as loyal Ford truck buyers expect the F-150 to look a certain way, but the Blue Oval is also projecting fuel economy gains thanks to the new <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/07/28/pricing-announced-aluminum-bodied-2015-ford-f150-up-395/">truck's use of lightweight aluminum</a>. And no matter how light the truck is, fuel-economy gains could be wiped out with poor aerodynamics. With that in mind, <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/07/31/2015-ford-f150-appearance-guide/">Ford styled the truck to maintain its beefy look</a>, but also beat its predecessor in the wind tunnel. Ford paid close attention to a new, lower air dam, mirrors that were redesigned "a dozen times" and a small lip on the rear tailgate. Acting as a spoiler, the lip allows air to cleanly detach from the body. Thanks to the smoke wand in the wind tunnel, you can actually <em>see</em> the difference tailgate up versus tailgate down <a href="/2014/08/26/ford-f-150-tailgate-up-down-mpg-video/">in our video</a>.<br />
<br />
Ford remains tight-lipped about the F-150's fuel economy numbers, but it admits dropping the tailgate would <em>increase</em> drag by about eight percent - and sandbag fuel economy. Even for older models without the fancy spoiler, you're hurting efficiency and lowering your gas mileage when driving with the tailgate down, argues Richards.<br />
<br />
So there's your verdict, straight from the wind tunnel: Leave the tailgate up.<p><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/26/ford-f-150-tailgate-up-down-mpg-video/" rel="bookmark">Continue reading <em>Which is more fuel efficient, driving with a pickup's tailgate up or down?</em></a></p><p style="padding:5px;background:#ddd;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/26/ford-f-150-tailgate-up-down-mpg-video/">Which is more fuel efficient, driving with a pickup's tailgate up or down?</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.autoblog.com">Autoblog</a> on Tue, 26 Aug 2014 19:57:00 EST.

BMW's Driftmob ad featuring the new M235i coupe was a huge production. So big, in fact, that the company wanted to tell the story from a behind-the-scenes perspective, and invited <em>Autoblog</em> to be the only US media outlet on hand during the ad's filming in Cape Town, South Africa.

<br />
It's a common refrain among auto enthusiasts to bemoan the current models being sold for being overly complex and expensive and to wish that automakers would just make vehicles like the old days. Sure, they might not have been as safe or efficient, but there was often a certain rugged simplicity that's gone today. Well, <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/toyota/">Toyota</a> is actually doing it and thinks there's enough demand to put the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/toyota/land+cruiser/">Land Cruiser 70</a> back into production in Japan for its 30th anniversary. Sadly, it's only for one year.<br />
<br />
The original Land Cruiser 70 served a long life in Japan from 1984 to 2004. Even today, the proven model remains in production in some regions abroad. People in its home country still love the vehicle though, and Toyota is brushing off the mothballs to give customers what they want. For the first time ever there, it's also offering the double-cab pickup version in addition to the traditional enclosed body. The company thinks that it can move about 200 of these classic trucks this year, which isn't too shabby for a vehicle that's three decades old.<br />
<br />
Looking at the pictures above, these look like the same old Land Cruisers, but Toyota is updating them slightly to meet modern safety rules. The grille, hood and headlights are all tweaked, and they now come with airbags and anti-lock brakes. A 4.0-liter V6 is under the hood making 228 horsepower (170 kilowatts) and 266 lb-ft of torque (360 Newton-meters), and the only available gearbox is a five-speed manual. Part-time four-wheel drive is standard. If you're really afraid of getting stuck in the wilderness, locking front and rear differentials and a winch are available as options.<br />
<br />
Prices for these throwbacks start at 3.6 million yen ($34,600) for the SUV or 3.5 million yen (33,700) for the truck. <a href="/2014/08/26/toyota-land-cruiser-70-anniversary-japan-relaunch/#continued">Scroll down</a> to watch some videos of these awesome "new" models showing what they can do off-road, and to read Toyota's official announcement.<p><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/26/toyota-land-cruiser-70-anniversary-japan-relaunch/" rel="bookmark">Continue reading <em>Toyota celebrates 30th anniversary of Land Cruiser 70 with Japan rerelease [w/videos]</em></a></p><p style="padding:5px;background:#ddd;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/26/toyota-land-cruiser-70-anniversary-japan-relaunch/">Toyota celebrates 30th anniversary of Land Cruiser 70 with Japan rerelease [w/videos]</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.autoblog.com">Autoblog</a> on Tue, 26 Aug 2014 19:00:00 EST.

<p>A recent GAO report concluded car companies don't adequately disclose how and why they share location data.</p>
</blockquote>
As cars collect and store more and more data about the whereabouts of their drivers, automakers are responding to critics who say they should be more transparent about how those details are used. <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/ford/">Ford</a> is hiring a global privacy policy attorney to craft the company's customer privacy policies in the era of connected and autonomous cars.<br />
<br />
"In this emerging space, there is an important need to address customer privacy policies," <a href="https://sjobs.brassring.com/TGWEbHost/jobdetails.aspx?jobId=200193&amp;PartnerId=25385&amp;SiteId=5186&amp;codes=IND">reads a job description posted</a> on the "people and careers" portion of the company's website. "As part of our compliance and ethics organization at Ford, this person will have an immediate and direct impact in shaping existing and future policy and corporate thinking in this area."<br />
<br />
Ford is creating the new position, based at its Dearborn headquarters, at a time technology advances are outpacing privacy protections. Earlier this year, <a href="http://www.gao.gov/assets/670/660002.txt">a report from the federal government</a> concluded car companies don't adequately disclose to motorists how and why they share location data.<br />
<br />
That report, from the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/government+accountability+office/">Government Accountability Office</a>, found many car companies did not describe how they shared location data, did not allow consumers to request their data be deleted and that there was a "wide variation" in how car companies retained vehicle-specific or identifiable location data. It noted there is increased risk of location data being used in ways "consumers did not intend."<br />
<br />
Ford was one of 10 companies the GAO surveyed while compiling its report.<br />
<br />
Customers are opting to share that data largely by using features like maps and turn-by-turn direction that are run by a vehicle's telematics unit.

<blockquote class="pull-quote pull-quote-right">
<p>The goal of speed cameras should be to improve safety and change driver behavior, not to make motorists feel like they're being ripped off.</p>
</blockquote>
A speed-camera program in one Long Island county issued almost 40,000 tickets over the past month. They're all being expunged.<br />
<br />
A malfunction with the cameras caused them to cite motorists who didn't deserve the citations, according to Edward Mangano, Nassau County's top executive. As a result, the county plans to dismiss more than $2.4-million worth of tickets. Motorists who already have paid their citations will receive refunds.<br />
<br />
"I don't have a high confidence level that the cameras were operating at statutory levels," <a href="http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/edward-mangano-dismisses-2-4-million-in-speed-camera-tickets-1.9126860">Mangano tells <em>Newsday</em></a>. "So we are declaring amnesty with all tickets issued this summer."<br />
<br />
Six cameras responsible for the improper citations are located in school zones. Problems arose because the speed limit changes between 25 miles per hour and 40 mph, depending on whether the schools are in session. In some cases, motorists simply were not aware summer school was in session. In others, the cameras recorded violations at incorrect times.<p><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/26/speed-camera-tickets-dismissed-new-york-video/" rel="bookmark">Continue reading <em>Why one Long Island county dismissed $2.4 million in speed-camera fines [w/video]</em></a></p><p style="padding:5px;background:#ddd;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/26/speed-camera-tickets-dismissed-new-york-video/">Why one Long Island county dismissed $2.4 million in speed-camera fines [w/video]</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.autoblog.com">Autoblog</a> on Tue, 26 Aug 2014 17:30:00 EST.

<br />
The <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/bugatti/veyron+eb+16.4/">Veyron</a> is nearing the end of its production run, at the end of which <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/bugatti/">Bugatti</a> will have <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/07/15-bugatti-veyrons-left-report/">built</a> only 450 examples. Of those, only 150 will be roadsters, and of those roadsters, even fewer will be the Vitesse version that combines the best attributes of the Grand Sport and Super Sport models. And with a virtually endless array of <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2010/12/14/bugatti-launches-new-online-configurator-complete-with-rape-y/">color choices</a>, no two ever need be alike (safe for the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/16/bugatti-veyron-legends-editions-monterey-2014/">Legend editions</a>, each of which Bugatti will only build three examples). Yet certain examples have received extra-special treatments, and that's just what we have here.<br />
<br />
Called the L'Or Style edition, this Vitesse roadster features a similar treatment to the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2011/08/19/bugatti-veyron-lor-blanc-drips-exclusivity/">L'Or Blanc edition</a>, but in red and black instead of blue and white. Which is all well and fine, but what we're really interested in here is how it's being delivered. Because while it may seem like Bugatti's created another "one of a kind" Veyron every other day, it's not every day that you see how the logistics of delivering a $3 million supercar are handled.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, the Symbolic Motors group that includes in its portfolio the Bugatti San Diego franchise and which handled the sale of this particular Veyron, captured the delivery process on video. We'll let you <a href="/2014/08/26/bugatti-veyron-one-off-delivery-video/">watch for yourself</a> to see just how painstaking the process (even just that part caught on video) is - complete with wood-floored transporter truck, intake-perforated protective wrap and wheel spoke guards - but suffice it to say it's a bit more coddling than your average dealership delivery.<p><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/26/bugatti-veyron-one-off-delivery-video/" rel="bookmark">Continue reading <em>Delivering a one-off Bugatti Veyron Vitesse</em></a></p><p style="padding:5px;background:#ddd;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/26/bugatti-veyron-one-off-delivery-video/">Delivering a one-off Bugatti Veyron Vitesse</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.autoblog.com">Autoblog</a> on Tue, 26 Aug 2014 17:02:00 EST.

<br />
Remember when we used to talk about how close <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/lincoln/">Lincoln</a> was to being axed and how it seemed any day now the Grim Reaper would use it as a car service back to the grave? Last time we did it was, oh, <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/06/30/mulally-wanted-kill-lincoln-fields-vows-turn-around-report/">not even a month ago</a>. What a difference 27 days makes: <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/ford/">Ford</a> and Lincoln are trumpeting a $129M investment in the Louisville Assembly Plant that builds the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/lincoln/mkc/">MKC</a>.<br />
<br />
In July the MKC was the third-best-selling Lincoln of the brand's six offerings, beat by the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/lincoln/mkz/">MKZ</a> and - by a much smaller margin - the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/lincoln/mkx/">MKX</a>. It has sold 2,895 units in the two months it's been on sale, which is more than half the year-to-date sales of the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/lincoln/mks/">MKS</a>, <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/lincoln/mkt/">MKT</a> and <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/lincoln/navigator/">Navigator</a>. It's already important, is what we're trying to say, and this is before the Chinese market gets a crack at it later this year.<br />
<br />
The money headed to Kentucky will be joined by 300 new workers, another marker in Ford's march to create 12,000 hourly jobs in the US by next year.

<br />
Automotive naming schemes can get a little bit weird as they age. Just look at the impending <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/bmw/">BMW</a> lineup with a rear-wheel drive <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/bmw/2+series/">2 Series</a> and front-wheel drive <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/bmw+2+series+active+tourer/">2 Series Active Tourer</a> on sale together - of course, to say nothing of the fact that the 2 Series is actually the successor to the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/bmw/1+series/">1 Series</a> coupe/convertible in the States. Crazy. However, <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> might be taking steps in the opposite direction to actually make its SUV and crossover lineup easier for customers to understand.<br />
<br />
The first potential shift is dropping the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/mercedes-benz/m-class/">M-Class</a> name from the range because it just no longer fits within a naming structure that has SUVs and CUVs all starting with G. According to <em>Car and Driver</em> speaking with unnamed Mercedes insiders, <a href="http://blog.caranddriver.com/mercedes-benz-to-revise-nomenclature-m-class-first-up-becomes-gle-class-early-next-year/">when the crossover gets refreshed with updated styling in 2015, it's also getting a new name: GLE-Class</a>. Then, when the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/mercedes+concept+coupe+suv/">Concept Coupe SUV</a> goes into production, it would be called the GLE Coupe.<br />
<br />
The rumored changes to the M-Class might be only the beginning, though. Once the GLE falls in place, the future version of the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/mercedes-benz/glk-class/">GLK-Class</a> would possibly become the GLC-Class. Just those two revisions would give the Mercedes' mainstream SUV and CUV range a similar hierarchy as its sedans with the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/mercedes-benz/gla-class/">GLA-Class</a>, GLC-Class, GLE-Class and <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/mercedes-benz/gl-class/">GL-Class</a> all having roughly corresponding models, plus the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/mercedes-benz/g-class/">G-Class</a> out on its own as its incomparable self. If it all actually happens, the re-naming should make the lineup easier to understand. <em>Autoblog</em> reached out to Mercedes spokesperson Christian Bokich to confirm all of this, but all he would say is, "I'm afraid that it's too early to tell at this point."<p style="padding:5px;background:#ddd;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/26/mercedes-benz-m-class-gle-class-next-year-report/">Mercedes M-Class to become GLE-Class next year</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.autoblog.com">Autoblog</a> on Tue, 26 Aug 2014 15:32:00 EST.

We arrive in Cape Town, South Africa, on the third and final practice day for the drivers of a BMWStories internet video called <em>The Epic Driftmob feat. BMW M235i</em>. We are immediately whisked to a large, empty parking lot on the outskirts of Cape Town, where tires are squealing and chunks of rubber are flying as five red <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/bmw/2+series/">BMW M235i</a> coupes churn up more smoke than a California wildfire. And the smell - it smells like heated metal, the kind of thing rev limiters are made for. Times five.<br />
<br />
A couple dozen locals have lined up along a chain link fence, lured like moths to a flame by the sounds and scents and plumes of smoke emanating from the site. Each has their camera ready for the moment stunt coordinator Riley Harper says, "Action!"<br />
<br />
This event - and <em>Autoblog's</em> involvement in it, specifically - was more or less an experiment on BMW's part to see if there is a story to be told from video production and photo shoots, normally marketing endeavors and something PR folks keep independent documentarians like us a long way away from. We were the only US media outlet invited, and we weren't there to drive a new product, just to take in one of its current (and in our opinion, one of its best) cars, the M235i coupe, do amazing things at the hands of some of the world's best drifters.<p><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/26/bmw-m235i-driftmob-behind-the-scenes-feature-video/" rel="bookmark">Continue reading <em>Behind the scenes of BMW's 'Driftmob' [w/videos]</em></a></p><p style="padding:5px;background:#ddd;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/26/bmw-m235i-driftmob-behind-the-scenes-feature-video/">Behind the scenes of BMW's 'Driftmob' [w/videos]</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.autoblog.com">Autoblog</a> on Tue, 26 Aug 2014 14:58:00 EST.

In case there aren't enough on the roads in your area to make the case, <em>Corvette Blogger</em> reports that at last weekend's <a href="http://www.carlisleevents.com/carlisle-events/corvettes-at-carlisle/default.aspx">Corvettes at Carlisle</a> show, General Motors showed a graphic putting the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/chevrolet/corvette/">2014 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray</a> production run at 37,288 units. That is about equal to the last three years of the C6 Corvette - combined - and includes Premiere Editions, regular retail sales, and "exports and captured fleet cars that were sellable units" according to Corvette product manager Harlan Charles. Coupes and convertibles equipped with the Z51 package outsold their base versions, and Torch Red narrowly beat Arctic White as the exterior hue of choice.<br />
<br />
While <a href="http://www.corvettes.com/history/corvette-production-by-year.php">that number ranks 14th</a> on the all-time annual production chart, it's a very strong showing in the "modern era," going back 30 years to the introduction of the C3. In this millennium it's only beat by the <a href="http://vettefacts.com/C6/2005.aspx">first year of C6 production</a> in 2005 at 37,372 units (when black was the best selling color and the Z51 only reached 40.8 percent of sales), and the <a href="http://www.vettefacts.com/C6/2007.aspx">third year of C6 production</a> that hit 40,561 units (black was still the best color and 65.5 percent of buyers checked the Z51 box). Before that, you'd have to go all the way back to 1985 for a higher number.<br />
<br />
The <a href="http://tech.corvettecentral.com/2013/04/c6-production-numbers/">second year of C6 production</a> declined even with the introduction of the Z06 - we'll see if the C7 <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/20/2015-corvette-rated-29-mpg-eight-speed-automatic/">Stingray's enhancements</a> for the 2015 model year and the sales help of the bonkers yet <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/22/2015-chevy-corvette-z06-price-power-vs-rivals/">absurdly reasonably priced Z06</a> can prevent that.

<a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/scuderia+cameron+glickenhaus/">Scuderia Cameron Glickenhaus</a> has made (or commissioned) two vehicles to date - the P4/5 and the P4/5 Competizione - and is now hard at work on its third. The first was based on the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/ferrari+enzo/">Ferrari Enzo</a> and the second on a <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/ferrari/f430/">Ferrari F430</a>, but the third is being developed independently from the ground up. The question, then, is what engine will it use?<br />

Well now we may have our answer as <em>Jalopnik</em> reports that the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/sgc+003/">SCG 003</a> (as it's known at the moment) will be powered by a 3.5-liter V6 sourced from <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/honda/">Honda</a>, fitted with twin turbochargers and producing in excess of 500 horsepower.<br />
<br />
Honda's J35Y engine produces 278 horsepower in the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/honda/accord/">Accord</a>, 290 hp in the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/acura/mdx/">Acura MDX</a> and 310 hp in the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/acura/rlx/">RLX</a>. It also forms the basis for the HR35TT racing engine which <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/hpd/">Honda Performance Development</a> puts in its <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/03/14/honda-riley-daytona-prototype-official/">Daytona Prototype</a>, so if the rumors turn out to be true, chances are that's probably the engine in question - with the possible addition of a hybrid electric assist - but we'll have to sit tight to find out for sure.<p style="padding:5px;background:#ddd;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/26/glickenhaus-scg-003-twin-turbo-honda-v6-rumor/">Glickenhaus's SCG 003 to pack twin-turbo Honda V6?</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.autoblog.com">Autoblog</a> on Tue, 26 Aug 2014 14:00:00 EST.

<br />
Nearly 300 people have filed claims in the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/gm/">General Motors</a> <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/ignition+switch+recall/">ignition switch recall case</a>, with around 100 claiming the defect led to their loved ones' fatal crashes while 184 people claim they were injured in crashes caused by the recalled ignition switch. The period for filing claims opened on August 1.<br />
<br />
According to <em>The Detroit Free Press</em>, each claimant must prove that the ignition switch was the cause of the crash that led to the injury or death. Provided the ignition switch was proven to be the "proximate cause" behind the crash, GM's compensation boss, <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/kenneth+feinberg/">Ken Feinberg</a>, will <a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20140825/BUSINESS0101/308250200/GM-ignition-switch-recall-Ken-Feinberg">use actuarial tables and medical cost data</a> to determine individual payouts. Families of those killed will get at least $1 million from the uncapped settlement fund, which GM is expecting to cost $400 to $600 million.<br />
<br />
As <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/06/30/ken-feinberg-general-motors-ignition-switch-recall-compensation-plan/">we've reported previously</a>, claims can be filed through the end of 2014, with payouts to begin 90 to 180 days after the initial filing. You can expect to hear plenty more about these payouts over the coming months.<p style="padding:5px;background:#ddd;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/26/gm-recall-death-claims/">Death claim in GM ignition-switch lawsuit rises to 100</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.autoblog.com">Autoblog</a> on Tue, 26 Aug 2014 13:28:00 EST.

<br />
From 1927 to 1957, the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/mille+miglia/">Mille Miglia</a> was one of the great, romantic European road races of the golden era of motorsports. The cars were fast, beautiful and loud but also extremely dangerous and regularly claimed drivers' lives. After two fatal accidents in '57, the event finally had to reform and came back in 1977 as a historic rally held over the course of several days. That didn't make things boring, though, and <em>Xcar</em> found that out firsthand with a front-row seat to this year's race in a <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/jaguar+f-type+r+coupe/">2015 Jaguar F-Type R Coupe</a>.<br />
<br />
<em>Xcar</em> was actually following the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/jaguar/">Jaguar</a> team this year that included Ian Callum and Jay Leno in an <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/jaguar+xk120/">XK120</a>, which we previously got a glimpse of when it <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/06/02/leno-ian-callum-pilot-jaguar-xk120-2014-mille-miglia-video/">was covered on <em>Jay Leno's Garage</em></a>. Where Leno focuses on a more personal story of competing, this one takes a more macro view. You really get an idea of how crazy the Mille Miglia still is, and while the F-Type is way too new to actually compete in the rally, it can still wear an event sticker and drive with the vintage racers.<br />
<br />
One amazing fact about today's Mille Miglia is that if you're competing in the event, there are basically no rules. The roads are technically still open to traffic, but the police shut down intersections and provide a rolling roadblock. <em>Xcar</em>'s F-Type alternated between following on the course with the classics and snipping off chunks of the route to watch the participants arrive at each stop. Check out the video to experience fantastic historic rally.<p><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/26/mille-miglia-video-xcar/" rel="bookmark">Continue reading <em>Here's what a front-row seat looked like in 2014 Mille Miglia</em></a></p><p style="padding:5px;background:#ddd;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/26/mille-miglia-video-xcar/">Here's what a front-row seat looked like in 2014 Mille Miglia</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.autoblog.com">Autoblog</a> on Tue, 26 Aug 2014 12:46:00 EST.

<br />
<a href="http://www.autoblog.com/bmw/">BMW</a> is taking a page from the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/harley-davidson/">Harley-Davidson</a> playbook with its groundbreaking R NineT. A retro <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/cafe+racer/">cafe racer</a> with an urban hooligan twist, the bike is fully customizable from fork to exhaust. Of course, any motorcycle can be customized, but the fact that BMW has built its newest bike to encourage modification using parts that can be swapped with simple tools is a radical move for a motorcycle maker best known for its plug-and-play touring bikes.<br />
<br />
To underscore exactly how radical, BMW has even partnered with custom heavy-hitter Roland Sands Design, which developed the initial concept for the bike and is now manufacturing a full line of parts and accessories for the R NineT, including radial valve covers ($950), retro racing saddles ($400-$420), radial gauge housing ($400) and a radial headlight bezel ($250), among other things, all of which can be swapped with a socket wrench or screwdriver instead of a hacksaw, wire cutters and TIG welder.<br />
<br />
Alas, the bike I tested for two weeks was stock, so consider it a blank canvas.<br />
<br />
In development since 2011, the $15,395 R NineT is a tribute to BMW's 1973 R90S superbike. As such, it's powered by a classic flat-twin that's been modernized with a gigantic 1,170-cc displacement and oil as well as air cooling. From the saddle, looking down, the protruding cylinders make the bike look as stocky as one would expect for a machine of German provenance. It's as if the R NineT is powered with wienerschnitzel instead of 91 octane.<p><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/26/2014-bmw-r-ninet/" rel="bookmark">Continue reading <em>2014 BMW R NineT</em></a></p><p style="padding:5px;background:#ddd;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/26/2014-bmw-r-ninet/">2014 BMW R NineT</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.autoblog.com">Autoblog</a> on Tue, 26 Aug 2014 11:57:00 EST.

<br />
Being pulled over by the police is one of the most nerve-racking situations that a driver can go through, and it's even worse when you know that the officer has you dead to rights for speeding well over the posted limit. In this video, the driver of a heavily modified <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/ford/mustang/">Ford Mustang</a> with a claimed 966 horsepower at the rear wheels could have easily lost his ride for doing triple-digit speeds and street racing, but a friendly Texas police officer appears to send him on his way with a simple warning.<br />
<br />
What's more, the driver in question wasn't just speeding - his Mustang was the camera car for a bunch of rolling street races in the wee hours of the morning on a Texas highway. The driver was more than willing to mix it up in the action, too. Eventually the cops catch on and pick the 'Stang to pull over, but not before the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/ford/">Ford</a> owner runs a claimed 140 mph. With only audio to go on after the car is pulled over, the police officer seems incredibly nonchalant about catching someone who was so brazenly breaking the law. Incredibly, the patrolman actually tells the driver that he's seen everyone racing tonight but ignored them. With traffic picking up, the cop says that it's time to "cut it out" and go home for the night. As far as this video shows, that was the end of it.<br />
<br />
Warning: There is explicit, not-safe-for-work language in the video <a href="/2014/08/26/tx-police-let-140-mph-street-racer-go/">below</a>.<br />
<br />
What do you think, should the officer have let the motorist go with just a warning, or was he being too generous? Let us know in the poll below and in Comments.<br />

<br />
We know what you're thinking, and yes, friends, it can be yours. This two-tone <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/chevrolet/corvette/">Chevrolet Corvette </a>comes from Eagle, Idaho, a product of Z and M Customs in homage to the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2009/02/11/chicago-2009-gm-finally-rolls-out-corvette-stingray-concept/">Corvette Stingray Concept</a> that played the Autobot Sideswipe in the second <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/transformers/"><em>Transformers</em></a> film, <em>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen</em>. According to the seller, Arcturus401, Z and M only got nine of them out the door before <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/gm/">General Motors</a> expressed a lawyerly displeasure, and this is the only two-tone example among them.<br />
<br />
Underneath the custom panels lives a 2006 C6 'Vette with an automatic transmission, black leather interior and extras like a head-up display, cold-air intake, a hood that opens electronically and a custom exhaust. A two-owner coupe, it's got 59,900 miles and a salvage title, but we're told its original owner only had the <em>Transformers</em> plastic surgery done in 2011.<br />

Having just relisted it, at the time of this writing, the bidding is up to $6,200, and we don't see any notes about a reserve. If you're into this sort of thing, that could be considered a bargain: when another one of those nine owners <a href="http://www.autoevolution.com/news/corvette-stingray-concept-replica-from-z-and-m-customs-26880.html">put his blue example on eBay</a> in 2010, he wanted at least $42,500.

<br />
<a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/2015-volvo-xc90/#photo-2868068"><img alt="Dashboard of 2015 Volvo XC90" class="right border" data-credit="Volvo" data-mep="417607" src="http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/c3f3001565c0a5301831f9e8918d60e6/200643658/2015-volvo-xc90-int.jpg" /></a>It's been months since the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/01/08/volvo-concept-xc-coupe-official-video-detroit/">Concept XC Coupe</a> debuted at the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/detroit-auto-show/">Detroit Auto Show</a>, Volvo's last show car previewing its all-new <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/volvo/xc90/">2015 XC90</a>. But the production model is finally here after years of development, and it signals the future of the Swedish automaker with its Scalable Product Architecture modular platform and cutting-edge new engine family.<br />
<br />
The 2015 XC90 carries all-new styling, but is still familiar up front, with the company's logo slashing diagonally through its prominent, upright grille. Like the concept, it carries T-Shaped LED running lights through the headlights. The company calls them the "Thor's Hammer" design, an evocative designation that we think is fantastic. Under that new front end is a choice of two quite powerful, but very efficient powertrains. The standard XC90 gets a 2.0-liter turbocharged and supercharged engine with all-wheel drive making an impressive 316 horsepower. Or if buyers want to be a little greener <em>and</em> more powerful, there is the XC90 Twin Engine plug-in hybrid with the same engine, albeit augmented with an electric motor to produce a staggering 400 hp.<br />
<br />
The exterior styling is crisp, if not quite as sensual as Volvo's latest concepts, but we think the interior is the real star here, with a dashboard that looks like it came out of a Herman Miller catalog and a unique vertically oriented infotainment screen integrated into its center stack, perhaps taking a cue from <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tesla/">Tesla</a>. If the cabin feels as good as it looks, we think a lot of sales are going to be won inside.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.autoblog.com/volvo/">Volvo</a> prides itself on its safety reputation, and the new XC90 is no different with some brand-new tech. First, there's a run-off road protection package that absorbs energy between the seat and its frame that "cushions the vertical forces." There's also an intersection braking system that stops the crossover if it tries to pull out in front of an oncoming car.<br />
<br />
US pricing for the XC90 T6 AWD starts at $48,900, and comes standard with luxury features like nav and a panoramic sunroof. There's also going to be a limited run of 1,927 First Edition models (the date the brand was founded) that come with all of the options and special badges but have to be reserved online starting on September 3rd at 10:00 AM ET. Prices for these exclusive vehicles start at $65,900.<br />

<br />
Racing series typically select a safety car appropriate to the kinds of racecars for which they'll be setting the pace. So you might find a <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/mercedes-benz/sls+amg/">Mercedes SLS</a> pacing a <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/f1/">Formula One</a> grand prix, for example, and you're more likely to find a <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/bmw/m4/">BMW M4</a> on duty at a <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/dtm/">DTM</a> race and a <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/chevrolet/camaro/">Chevy Camaro</a> or <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/chevrolet/ss/">SS</a> on an oval speedway for a <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/nascar/">NASCAR</a> or <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/indy/">Indy</a> race. It would only stand to reason, then, that the <a href="http://green.autoblog.com/tag/formula+e/">FIA Formula E Championship</a> kicking off next month in Beijing would press a plug-in into service as its safety car. But the organizers didn't go for your run-of-the-mill <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/nissan/leaf/">Nissan Leaf</a> or <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/toyota/prius/">Toyota Prius</a>.<br />
<br />
No, the safety car for Formula E will be a <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/bmw/i8/">BMW i8</a> specially modified for the occasion. As you can see from the video below, the hybrid sports car packs a full roll cage, racing buckets with harnesses, special communications systems and on-board fire extinguishers. But that's not all.<br />
<br />
In partnership with technological partner Qualcomm, the Formula E support fleet - including two examples each of the i8 and <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/bmw/i3/">i3</a> - will feature inductive charging. So while one is out on the track, or at least sitting at the end of the pit lane waiting to be deployed - the other will be charging wirelessly. The vehicles are still pending FIA approval, and only one has been outfitted with the Qualcomm Halo wireless charging system (with the others to be retrofitted later), but they were all on hand for the recent practice race at Donnington Park.<br />
<br />
The Qualcomm Safety Car, as it will officially be known, will be driven by longtime <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/wtcc/">WTCC</a> safety car driver Bruno Correia of Portugal. Although no mention is made in the press release or the presentation <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/26/formula-e-bmw-i8-safety-car-wireless-charging-video/#continued">video below</a>, it's not hard to imagine that the Formula E series might seek to adopt this technology for the racers as well in the near future.<p><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/26/formula-e-bmw-i8-safety-car-wireless-charging-video/" rel="bookmark">Continue reading <em>Formula E gets wireless-charging BMW i8 safety car [w/video]</em></a></p><p style="padding:5px;background:#ddd;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/26/formula-e-bmw-i8-safety-car-wireless-charging-video/">Formula E gets wireless-charging BMW i8 safety car [w/video]</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.autoblog.com">Autoblog</a> on Tue, 26 Aug 2014 09:16:00 EST.

<br />
When a <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/bugatti/veyron+eb+16.4/">Bugatti Veyron</a> crashed on a highway in Austria a few months ago, insurance company AXA estimated the cost of repairs at upwards of $800,000. Of course, there were worries that even after all the repairs the car may never drive quite the same. So rather than try, the insurance company evidently wrote it off and paid the owner the insured value of the car. But now it's got the wrecked <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/bugatti/">Bugatti</a> on its hands, and is looking to offload it.<br />
<br />
This early model, built in 2008, has the original version's 987-horsepower 8.0-liter quad-turbo W16 engine, a fixed roof and a blue and black livery - unlike some more recent examples that have adopted a removable roof panel, employed a more powerful 1,184-hp engine and moved away from the original two-tone paint schemes. It's got nearly 20,000 miles on the odometer and would still require the better part of a million bucks to get it running again... at which point it could be worth more in spare parts, which surely don't come cheap from the manufacturer in Molsheim.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, with bidding currently hovering around a quarter million, you could just get yourself a brand spankin' new <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/ferrari/458+italia/">Ferrari 458 Italia</a>, <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/lamborghini/huracan/">Lamborghini Hurac&aacute;n</a> or <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/mclaren/650s/">McLaren 650S</a> and actually get to drive it without spending eight hundred grand on repairs. But if you were looking to pick up a Veyron on the cheap, regardless of condition, this could be your chance.<p style="padding:5px;background:#ddd;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/26/wrecked-bugatti-veyron-auction/">Is a wrecked Bugatti worth $250k?</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.autoblog.com">Autoblog</a> on Tue, 26 Aug 2014 08:44:00 EST.

<br />
Want to get your hands on a <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/noble/">Noble</a>? May we first compliment you on your choice, good sir or madam, because the British niche manufacturer produces some of the most direct, hardcore sports cars on the market. And that, thanks to <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/rossion/">Rossion</a> and its Noble-derived <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/rossion+q1/">Q1</a>, includes the United States. But if you live somewhere where Noble actually sells its own cars, you'll want to look at the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/noble+m600/">M600</a>.<br />
<br />
The Noble M600 is about as hardcore as they come. It packs a 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8 kicking out 650 horsepower to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual, and not much else: no ABS, no traction control, certainly no all-wheel drive. Just 650 horsepower and a curb weight of around 2,600 pounds. No flappy-paddle gearbox here, and no trick folding roof. Only those last bits are about to change.<br />
<br />
Speaking with Dutch publication <em>Autovisie</em>, Noble chief Peter Bolt Wood - a former racing and <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/ferrari+f40/">Ferrari F40</a> driver - revealed that his company is working on two new developments for the puritanical M600. One is an open roof, and the other some sort of paddle-shift transmission.<br />
<br />
This isn't the first time Noble will have created an open-top sportscar. In fact we <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2012/06/27/noble-hints-at-possible-roadster-version-of-m600-supercar/">reported</a> on the prospect of an M600 roadster a couple years ago when the company released a teaser image. But now it appears to be moving ahead with the plans.<br />
<br />
Details are sketchy at the moment, so we don't know if the former will be a simple removable roof panel, a folding soft top, a collapsible hardtop or something else. Nor do we know if the two-pedal gearbox will be a sequential, dual-clutch or torque-converter automatic. But Wood and company seem eager to break into new markets, and apparently see both developments as vital to its expansion, without sacrificing performance. Its order books may be full at the moment, but it's expanding into China, Taiwan and Japan.<br />

Here's hoping - with or without an open roof and paddle-shift transmission, through Rossion or on its own - it brings the M600 to North America soon as well.<p style="padding:5px;background:#ddd;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/26/noble-developing-m600-roadster-with-paddle-shifters/">Noble developing M600 roadster with paddle shifters</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.autoblog.com">Autoblog</a> on Tue, 26 Aug 2014 07:59:00 EST.

<br />
At the turn of the century, it was arguably the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/honda/civic/">Honda Civic</a> that best defined inexpensive performance tuning, and in the '50s it was the Tri-5 Chevys. One of the earliest platforms to gain a huge following among young people looking for a cheap way to go fast was the classic '<a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/1932+ford/">32 Ford Highboy Roadster</a>. This week, <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/jay+lenos+garage/"><em>Jay Leno's Garage</em></a> looks at one of the very first vehicles that defined the look of the hot rod heyday.<br />
<br />
This '32 Ford was built in the '40s and graced the cover of the fourth issue of Hot Rod Magazine back in 1948. All of the hot rods that you see shining at car shows today owe a serious debt of gratitude to this roadster. It bears all of the cues that define the look, including a notched frame and hidden door hinges. Under the three-piece hood is a flathead V8 boasting all sorts of period modifications, including copper cylinder heads. It was seriously fast in its era too, and proved it by reaching 112.21 miles per hour on a dry lakebed in 1947.<br />
<br />
These days, this hot rod is on display at the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/petersen+automotive+museum/">Petersen Automotive Museum</a>. Although, if you can't make it to California to see it, the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/united+states+postal+service/">United States Postal Service</a> is celebrating this <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/ford/">Ford</a> with <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/06/08/usps-hot-rod-forever-stamps/">one of its two hot rod Forever stamps</a>. Like Jay says in the video, in terms of hot rodding, "it all comes back to this." Check out the video to learn more about this rolling piece of tuning history.<p><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/25/jay-leno-1932-ford-highboy-roadster-video/" rel="bookmark">Continue reading <em>Jay Leno drives postcard-perfect '32 Ford Highboy Roadster</em></a></p><p style="padding:5px;background:#ddd;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/25/jay-leno-1932-ford-highboy-roadster-video/">Jay Leno drives postcard-perfect '32 Ford Highboy Roadster</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.autoblog.com">Autoblog</a> on Mon, 25 Aug 2014 20:00:00 EST.

<br />
With 1,058 horsepower and 992 pound-feet of torque on tap, the Ford GT-based Galpin GTR1 is a seriously capable supercar. Of course, with its questionable styling and $1 million price tag, it certainly isn't for everyone. Senior Editor Steven Ewing took the beast for a quick spin during the Monterey Car Week recently.

A couple of years ago, the <em>Translogic</em> team tested a weird jet ski-powered device called the Flyboard, from Zapata Racing. Now, that company is back with its latest creation, the Hoverboard. The <em>Translogic</em> team headed out to the water near San Diego, CA for some high-flying tricks, and it's all wrapped up you in the latest episode.<br />

<br />
In terms of tough competition, heavy-duty pickups are in a constant fight for top honors. And now, Ram can claim some new best-in-class numbers with its updated 2015 model year 2500 and 3500 Heavy Duty trucks. Ram says its trucks now have the segment-best ratings for torque, towing and payload, depending on configuration, of course. Check out the full details, here.<br />

Unlike your average - and by that we mean "working" - i8, this one pretty much just sits there, looking pretty.<br />
<br />
See, the i8 in question is just a promotional body shell. It's fullsize and being sold (we think) by a legit BMW dealer (<a href="http://www.laurelbmw.com/">Laurel BMW of Westmont</a>), so it's got strong ties to the real thing, but there's nothing inside. In fact, you can't open the doors or windows and the wheels don't move, unless you count the tiny rolling castors that are a part of the prop. There is no fancy plug-in hybrid powertrain - no powertrain of any sort, in fact - and it was "professionally crafted just for BMW dealers." The headlights do turn on, though, so that's something.<br />
<br />
What's most impressive, though, is that there are 50 bids for this non-working BMW. In fact, the bidding has climbed up to $16,000. For a car that can't fulfill its mission as a car, that's pretty impressive. Oh, and those bids have not yet hit the reserve price, so the dealer is obviously hoping it can get more money for this hollow BMW.<br />

<br />
<em>Car and Driver</em> threw a leg over the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/lamborghini/huracan/">Lamborghini Hurac&aacute;n</a> and rode it hard all around the 16-turn Circuito Internationale Nard&ograve;, next to the banked oval that's brought us many a top-speed video. On the way to discovering the bull calf sweetly eclipses the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/lamborghini/gallardo/">Gallardo</a> it replaces, CD also discovered that - comparing their own tests - it is faster from zero to 60 miles per hour than its paterfamilias, the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/lamborghini/aventador/">Aventador</a>.<br />
<br />
Now, we should all know that 0-60 tests are an imprecise discipline, but CD's Eric Tingwall torched the sprint in the Hurac&aacute;n in 2.5 seconds - yes, faster than a whole lot of other very expensive super-coupes. In the magazine's <a href="http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2012-lamborghini-aventador-lp700-4-road-test-review">last instrumented test</a> of the Aventador Aaron Robinson ran 3.0 seconds, and for more Aventador perspective we can compare <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/exotic/1201_2012_lamborghini_aventador_lp_700_4_test/"><em>Motor Trend</em>'s 2.8 seconds</a>, also scored at Nardo, <a href="http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-reviews/road-tests/2012-lamborghini-aventador-lp700-4"><em>Road &amp; Track</em> at 2.7 seconds</a> and Lamborghini's estimated 0-62 mph time of 2.9 seconds. Any way you chop that up, 2.5 seconds beats it. A bit of a shock, then: Lamborghini lists the Hurac&aacute;n's 0-62 mph time as 3.2 seconds.<br />
<br />
We'll get a more precise idea of the discrepancy when more tests come online, but for the moment - and in this one respect - we've got the $241,945, 602-horsepower Hurac&aacute;n showing its angry backside to the $397,500, 691-hp Aventador. Even if it remains true, though, we're not sure it matters; in a figurative case of Predator versus Alien, it's arguable that the only way to be wrong is not to own one.<p style="padding:5px;background:#ddd;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/25/lamborghini-huracan-quicker-than-aventador/">Lamborghini's Huracan quicker than its costlier Aventador?</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.autoblog.com">Autoblog</a> on Mon, 25 Aug 2014 18:30:00 EST.

<br />
<a href="http://www.autoblog.com/volvo/">Volvo</a> is an automaker committed to vehicle safety, setting an ambitious target for itself: by 2020, the Swedish automaker envisions that no one will be killed or seriously injured in one of its cars. In order to achieve that goal, Volvo has announced a new <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/proving+ground/">proving ground</a> designed specifically to test safety solutions.<br />
<br />
Called AstaZero, the new facility near the company's headquarters in Gothenburg, Sweden, is the result of a $70 million investment. It will cover some 500 acres, with over 60 acres of pavement, four city blocks and three and a half miles of highway. The Active Safety Test Area (the ASTA in AstaZero) will enable Volvo and its partners (including <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/scania/">Scania</a> trucks as well as government bodies and university development programs) to simulate city streets, highways, rural roads, roundabouts, T-junctions and more, combining traffic from cars, pedestrians, bicycles, motorcycles, buses, trucks and even animals in order to account for all manner of potential hazards.<br />
<br />
The facility will enable Volvo to test active safety systems and autonomous vehicle operations, and even allow robots to test its prototypes in an adaptive environment that aims to be more flexible than existing proving grounds.

<br />
This weekend the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/f1/">Formula One</a> circus returned from its summer break and dove head-first into the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/belgian+grand+prix/">Belgian Grand Prix</a>. And you know what that means... that's right: <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/eau+rouge/">Eau Rouge</a>.<br />
<br />
The legendary corner at the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/spa/">Circuit Spa-Francorchamps</a> is one of those fearsome bends that, like the Karussell at the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/nurburgring/">N&uuml;rburgring</a> or the Corkscrew at <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/laguna+seca/">Laguna Seca</a>, is arguably just as famous as the track of which it is part. Drivers come speeding down the start finish straight, veer left, then rocket uphill and to the right towards a blind crest at speeds exceeding 200 miles per hour.<br />
<br />
It sounds terrifying, but the pros compiled in this video make it look easy. That's how you know they're going fast. The clip brings together over two decades' worth of on-board footage from the Belgian Grand Prix, starting with <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/nelson+piquet/">Nelson Piquet</a> (Sr.) in 1991 and culminating with <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/nico+hulkenberg/">Nico Hulkenberg</a> at last year's race, taking in such world champions as <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/nigel+mansell/">Nigel Mansell</a>, <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/michael+schumacher/">Michael Schumacher</a>, <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/michael+schumacher/">Jacques Villeneuve</a>, <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/damon+hill/">Damon Hill</a>, <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/mika+hakkinen/">Mika Hakkinen</a>, <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/fernando+alonso/">Fernando Alonso</a>, <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/lewis+hamilton/">Lewis Hamilton</a> and <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/kimi+raikkonen/">Kimi Raikkonen</a> along the way.<br />
<br />
The only years that are missing are 1994 (when a chicane spoiled the fun in the wake of the fatal <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/roland+ratzenberger/">Ratzenberger</a> and <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/ayrton+senna/">Senna</a> crashes), 2003 (when Spa alternated with <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/magny+cours/">Magny-Cours</a> in France) and 2006 (when the race was not held).

<br />
Pop the hood on a <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/volvo/">Volvo</a> of recent vintage and you'll find four-, five-, six- and even eight-cylinder engines. But the Swedish automaker is downsizing its engines over the coming years. The new <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/volvo/xc90/">XC90</a>, set to be revealed later this week, will use a new family of four-cylinder engines (like the one pictured above). But that's not even the end of it as emerging reports speak of a new three-cylinder engine family in the works.<br />
<br />
The new 1.5-liter turbocharged three-cylinder engine will, according to reports, help Volvo further cut its carbon emissions in line with constricting regulations in markets like Europe and Australia. There won't be quite as many versions as the four-cylinder range, which will include gasoline and diesel versions in varying states of tune, but the three-pot motor is tipped to be employed in vehicles as large as the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/volvo/s60/">S60</a> and its stablemates. Larger than that, however, and the three-cylinder engine apparently just doesn't have the necessary torque.<br />
<br />
Expect the new three-cylinder engine to be introduced sometime later this decade, after the four-cylinder's introduction in 2016. The three-cylinder engine is also set to form the building block of an even more efficient hybrid propulsion system in the future, enabling this new engine family to stay relevant through 2025.<p style="padding:5px;background:#ddd;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/25/volvo-three-cylinder-engine-family-report/">Volvo developing new three-cylinder engine family</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.autoblog.com">Autoblog</a> on Mon, 25 Aug 2014 16:27:00 EST.

<br />
The seventh-generation <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/volkswagen/golf/">Volkswagen Golf</a> (pictured above) only went on sale in the US in August, but it has been on the road in some parts of the world since 2012. The German automotive giant isn't taking a moment's rest for one of its most well known models, though. The latest rumor suggests that VW is already developing the eighth revision of its bread-and-butter hatchback, and it may be ready for launch as soon as 2017.<br />
<br />
The rumors come courtesy of German magazine <em>Auto Motor und Sport</em>, and <a href="http://www.auto-motor-und-sport.de/news/neuer-vw-golf-viii-flacher-breiter-sparsamer-8547795.html">it claims that the new model will receive a thorough restyling of the current look</a>. Not only will this mean the usual changes to the front and rearend design, but the next Golf will also be wider and sit lower than the current one, according to the magazine.<br />
<br />
However, the real focus for the new generation will be more sophisticated powertrain, infotainment and safety tech. To meet Europe's tightening emissions rules, VW will reportedly try to cut the Golf's weight by about 110 pounds with lighter engines. Cylinder deactivation for some powerplants and possibly even a three-cylinder option are on the table, according to <em>Auto Motor und Sport</em>. Other recent rumors suggest that <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/18/how-vws-hyper-efficient-xl1-will-influence-the-next-golf/">the next Golf model even use variable-compression and an electric turbo system</a> to further shed CO2 emissions.<br />
<br />
Much of the other technology will trickle down from <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/07/03/2015-volkswagen-passat-euro-spec-images/">the forthcoming, European-spec Passat</a> that will go on sale later this year. The Golf will supposedly get the sedan's pedestrian recognition system, parking assist, head-up display and Mirror-Link - a way to link the driver's smartphone interface to the infotainment screen.<br />
<br />
Of course the big question is when the eighth generation will make it to North America.

If you want to build a cheap truck that can still do dirty deeds off the beaten path, it's best to start with solid axles and a solid V8 engine. That sums up the lessons learned after watching the 2014 Cheap Truck Challenge from the Dirt Every Day video crew, who took to the deserts and surrounding areas near Reno, NV, in an attempt to find the best 4x4 for under $4,000. Fortunately for us, the whole sordid journey was captured on video.<br />
<br />
This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkBe7wBy_fY">isn't the first time</a> the boys from DED <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIp9wG5p8gE">filmed a Cheap Truck Challenge</a>, and this year's festivities pitted together a 1993 Chevy S10 pickup, a <a href="http://autoblog.com/jeep/grand+cherokee/">1995 Jeep Grand Cherokee</a> and a 1975 International truck in a series of challenges ranging from donuts to drag races, with plenty of hill-climbing and rock-crawling action in between. We don't want to spoil all the fun, but suffice it to say one competitor was found to be lacking while the other two performed (mostly) well. See for yourself in the video above.<p><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/25/dirt-every-day-2014-cheap-truck-challenge-video/" rel="bookmark">Continue reading <em>Dirt Every Day tries to find the best 4x4 for under $4k</em></a></p><p style="padding:5px;background:#ddd;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/25/dirt-every-day-2014-cheap-truck-challenge-video/">Dirt Every Day tries to find the best 4x4 for under $4k</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.autoblog.com">Autoblog</a> on Mon, 25 Aug 2014 14:58:00 EST.

<br />
It has taken <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/category/alfa-romeo/">Alfa Romeo</a> years of promises to finally, truly return to the US with the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/alfa+romeo/4c/">4C</a> sports coupe and <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/06/10/alfa-romeo-north-america-dealer-list/">its initial 86-dealer network</a>. We already know that the sporty Italian brand has more models on the way in near future, with a midsize sedan, crossovers and more headed our way <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/05/06/alfa-romeo-new-products-us/">according to the company's five-year plan</a>. Now, the latest rumor from an unnamed source <a href="http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/alfa-romeo/88334/new-alfa-romeo-6c-will-aim-to-topple-the-f-type">speaking to <em>Auto Express</em></a>, claims that Alfa has another, more powerful sports car on the slate to take on an even higher rung of performance vehicles, cars like the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/jaguar/f-type/">Jaguar F-Type</a>.<br />
<br />
The so-called Alfa Romeo 6C would launch as a coupe with the twin-turbocharged V6 engine from <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/maserati/ghibli/">Maserati Ghibli</a> (which makes 404 horsepower in that application) and a convertible would join the lineup later. The Alfa's platform would come directly from the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/03/04/maserati-alfieri-concept-geneva-2014/">Maserati Alfieri</a>, which <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/05/06/maserati-confirms-2015-levante-suv-2016-alfieri/">is supposed to launch in 2016</a>. In terms of styling, the insider describes the new coupe as closer to the earlier <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/alfa+romeo+8c+competizione/">8C Competizione</a> than the 4C. That suggests a front-engine, rear-wheel drive layout, plenty of gorgeous curves and the brand's long-lived shield grille flanked by LED headlights up front.<br />
<br />
<em>Auto Express'</em> source claims a 2017 launch date for the new range, and that could fit in Alfa's already-announced product plan. In its five-year forecast, the company said a specialty car would join the ranks from 2016-2018. At the time, we assumed this would be the sibling to the next-gen <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/mazda/mx-5/">Mazda MX-5 Miata</a>. However, the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/03/03/fiat-mazda-alfa-romeo-roadster-doubt-question-poll-report/">Italian end of the project was more recently reported to be in doubt</a>, with thoughts that the codeveloped model may end up wearing a <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/fiat/">Fiat</a> badge. The 6C could be an interesting alternative if the project comes to fruition.<p style="padding:5px;background:#ddd;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/25/alfa-romeo-6c-jaguar-f-type-rival/">Alfa Romeo to gun for Jag F-Type with 6C</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.autoblog.com">Autoblog</a> on Mon, 25 Aug 2014 14:14:00 EST.

<br />
<a href="http://www.autoblog.com/toyota/">Toyota</a> has announced that it will be making a $100 million investment in its Princeton, IN factory in a bid to increase production of its popular <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/toyota/highlander/">Highlander CUV</a>. The move will create 300 new jobs by 2016 and increase the total number of crossovers the plant can produce by 30,000.<br />
<br />
Toyota currently builds the Highlander, alongside the fullsize <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/toyota/sequoia/">Sequoia</a>, at Toyota Indiana's West Plant. The additional capacity, though, will be sent to the East Plant, which is currently responsible for production of the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/07/17/2015-toyota-sienna-se-official-photos-video/">recently refreshed</a> <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/toyota/sienna/">Sienna</a> minivan.<br />
<br />
"The Highlander has been a great product for our plant," Toyota Indiana President Norm Bafunno said in a statement. "Establishing Highlander as the 'bridge vehicle,' as we call it, between the East and West plants increases our ability to meet customer needs for our outstanding products. This exciting news is a true testament to the capability of our hard-working and dedicated team members."<br />

In 2012, <em>Translogic</em> featured a unique jet ski-powered device known as the <a href="http://translogic.aolautos.com/2012/10/08/translogic-114-water-powered-flyboard/">Flyboard</a>, which transformed its pilot into a sort of aquatic Iron Man. With hydro-thrusters at the hands and feet, Flyboard enabled water-powered flight and incredible ariel tricks.<br />
<br />
The folks from Zapata Racing are back with their latest innovation, the Hoverboard. If Flyboard drew comparisons to Tony Stark's metal suit, Hoverboard is sure to conjure up another pop-culture touchstone: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkyLnWm1iCs">Marty McFly's hovering skateboard</a> from <em>Back To The Future Part II</em>.<br />
<br />
<em>Translogic</em> Host Jonathon Buckley heads to San Diego, CA to meet with the founder of <a href="http://aquaticaviation.net/">Aquatic Aviation</a>, a US distributor of both aquatic devices, and attempts some high-flying tricks on the water-powered Hoverboard.<p><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/25/translogic-157-water-powered-hoverboard/" rel="bookmark">Continue reading <em>Translogic 157: Water-powered Hoverboard</em></a></p><p style="padding:5px;background:#ddd;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/25/translogic-157-water-powered-hoverboard/">Translogic 157: Water-powered Hoverboard</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.autoblog.com">Autoblog</a> on Mon, 25 Aug 2014 12:44:00 EST.

<br />
Last year in Monterey, <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2013/08/16/galpin-ford-gtr1-supercar-monterey-2013/">we met GTR1 for the first time</a>. <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/galpin+auto+sports/">Galpin Auto Sports</a> pulled the wraps off its <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/ford+gt/">Ford GT</a>-based supercar, powered by a twin-turbocharged 5.4-liter V8 good for a whopping 1,024 horsepower and 739 pound-feet of torque. The thing was totally custom-made and reportedly took some 12,000 man hours to create. And there it sat on the Pebble Beach grass, $1,000,000-plus price tag and all.<br />
<br />
This year, the Galpin was back, albeit with one big change. That twin-turbo engine? Gone. In its place, a 5.4-liter V8 with a 4.0-liter Whipple supercharger bolted on, delivering an astonishing 1,058 hp and 992 lb-ft of torque on 110-octane fuel. 0-60? 2.9 seconds. Top speed? Somewhere above 225 miles per hour.<br />
<br />
"Some things to keep in mind: no stability control, no traction control," were the only warnings given by Galpin's Brandon Boeckmann before taking me on a quick spin in the supercar. And after having my eyes thrown into the back of my skull a few times, laughing hysterically and trying to regain full use of my hearing after my ear drums being bombarded by the apocalyptic roar behind me, Brandon pulled over and said it was my turn, if I was ready to take the wheel.<br />
<br />
<em>Gulp</em>.<br />

<strong>Driving Notes</strong>

<ul>
	<li>Getting in and out of the GTR1 is the same awkward experience it is with the Ford GT. The doors extend into the roof panels, so you have to open wide. You don't really hop in so much as you sort of throw yourself into the driver's chair. The seat grips you tight, you reach down and slide the chair forward. You instinctively tilt your head to the right as you pull the door closed. At that moment, you're greeted with a familiar interior - though in a jarringly unfamiliar all-blue color scheme, here - with a small steering wheel and familiarly long, horizontal row of gauges that extend out to the middle of the dash.</li>
	<li>Turn the key in the ignition, hit the red engine start button in the center stack, and the GTR1 comes to live with a noise that cannot be precisely described. It's loud. No, <em>louder</em>. No, louder than that. It's so loud that the Galpin crew were not able to test it at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca because it exceeds the track's noise restrictions. It is <em>illegally</em> loud. And you won't be able to get enough.</li>
	<li>Pulling away at low speeds, the GTR1 chugs to life, with a throttle and clutch that are surprisingly easy to modulate. There's a progressive nature to the go-pedal, too - all that power isn't available right at the start. Good thing, too, so you can actually pull out onto the road with some dignity, and you won't get the back end to kick out until you're deeper into the throttle's travel.</li>
	<li>The shift lever has been shortened versus the standard GT, and the gears are selected with a solid, shorter-throw action, too. You don't feel like you're trying to move the earth when shifting gears in the Galpin - it's pretty easy, and feels natural. It reminds me of the stock Ford GT in this regard - incredibly capable, but very easy to drive.</li>
	<li>Now, to be clear, I didn't even reach close to the car's full potential on my street drive. I was limited to the roads of the Monterey Peninsula, and while there were plenty of great curves to throw the GTR1 into, it is simply too powerful to explore its limits on public streets.</li>
	<li>From what I can surmise, Galpin engineers have done a nice job of not only keeping the spirit of the Ford GT intact, they've added some of that conceptual madness in a way that's easy to manage. The steering is generally good, with a direct action that isn't overly touchy, allowing the driver to correct the occasional bouts of oversteer with ease.</li>
	<li>The ride height has been lowered, and the car rides on 20-inch wheels with super grippy Pirelli PZero tires. The ride is rather harsh, considering the overall lack of suspension travel, but it won't break your back. The comfortable, supportive seats keep things copacetic from inside, too - even if you do hit a particularly jarring bump, you won't be thrown around inside the cockpit.</li>
	<li>Most impressive, though, are the brakes, able to absolutely halt the speeding GTR1 on a dime. The car uses carbon-carbon rotors, and they stop. <em>Immediately</em>. Yet they don't feel snatchy when you don't need 100-percent, remaining well-modulated and progressive.</li>
	<li>The only thing I'm not fully in love with is the styling. From the rear three-quarter view, the GTR1 looks really cool, and reasonably unique. But from the front, I can't help but think it still looks like a less-attractive GT, with some odd <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/jaguar/xk/">Jaguar XK</a> cues thrown in there, too. That said, it gets a ton of attention - everyone on the road gave me the thumbs-up, and cyclists on the side of the road waved me by, some urging me to slam the throttle and give them the full brunt of the Galpin's noise and fury. Monterey Car Week brings out some really interesting stuff to the peninsula in northern California, and even in this company, I was a rock star.</li>
	<li>Galpin Auto Sports has six Ford GT chassis standing by, reading to fill orders for the monstrous supercar for those able to handle the over $1-million starting price. But you'll get a car that's built to order, with the interior and exterior able to be fully customized. Of course, with enough time and money, pretty much anything is possible.</li>
</ul>
All in, the GTR1 is a wonderful car to drive - to say it's fast, or quick, doesn't even explain it all. The car takes to the streets with an outstanding prowess, and the only car it reminds me of is the Ford GT on which it's based. It's loud, brutish, and absolutely absurd. And like the GT was so many years ago, the Galpin is like nothing else you can drive today.<p style="padding:5px;background:#ddd;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/25/2015-galpin-ford-gtr1-quick-spin-review/">2015 Galpin Ford GTR1</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.autoblog.com">Autoblog</a> on Mon, 25 Aug 2014 11:57:00 EST.

That's the price difference between the current EV sales champion, which now <a href="http://green.autoblog.com/2014/01/08/2014-nissan-leaf-increase-28980/">starts at $28,980</a>, and the just-announced price for the e-Golf, which will sell for $35,445 in the US when it arrives in about ten states (basically, the ZEV states that follow California's lead in zero-emission vehicle rules) this November and will qualify for the federal tax credit of up to $7,500.<br />
<br />
VW says that the extra money will get you "the most versatile electric vehicle in its class." There is only one trim line, the SEL Premium, which will be the first VW in the US with all-LED headlights. The car's powertrain numbers pretty much match the Nissan Leaf, though. The e-Golf has a 24.2-kWh lithium-ion battery (the Leaf has a 24-kWh pack) and a 115-hp, 199-pound foot electric motor (107 hp,187 lb-ft in the Leaf). The e-Golf's official EPA numbers are not yet available, but VW says it will have an "average range between 70 and 90 miles." The Leaf has an official EPA range of <a href="http://green.autoblog.com/2013/02/21/2013-nissan-leaf-revealed-gets-75-mile-range-actually-84-in-n/">84 miles</a>.<br />
<br />
The e-Golf has a better onboard charger - 7.2 kW vs. 3.6 or 6.6, depending on your Leaf's options - and has SAE Combo fast charging capability as standard. VW is also working with 3Degrees to offset all of the emissions "created from production, distribution and charging of the e-Golf for up to approximately 36,000 miles of driving."<br />
<br />
VW also announced prices for its lightly facelifted <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/volkswagen/jetta/">2015 Jetta</a> today. The base model, the 2.0-liter S with a manual transmission, starts at $17,325 while the top-of-the-line model, the Hybrid SEL Premium, will set you back at least $31,670. The lowest-cost TDI is the S manual, which starts at $21,640 and features VW's new 2.0-liter diesel four. A new limited-edition 1.8 Sport model with a firmer suspension, tinted taillamps and rear spoiler starts at $20,895. All VW prices listed exclude VW's *$820 destination charge and you can find all the details on trim lines in the press releases <a href="/2014/08/25/2015-vw-e-golf-jetta-pricing/#continued">below</a>.<p><a href="http://green.autoblog.com/2014/08/25/2015-vw-e-golf-jetta-pricing/" rel="bookmark">Continue reading <em>2015 VW e-Golf coming to ZEV states for $35,445* this November</em></a></p><p style="padding:5px;background:#ddd;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://green.autoblog.com/2014/08/25/2015-vw-e-golf-jetta-pricing/">2015 VW e-Golf coming to ZEV states for $35,445* this November</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://green.autoblog.com">Autoblog Green</a> on Mon, 25 Aug 2014 11:30:00 EST.

<br />
Changeable. Each commentator will use that word at least 6,072 times over the Belgian <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/f1/">Formula One</a><br />
Grand Prix weekend. It is almost always applied to the weather, because the Spa-Francorchamps Circuit - perhaps all of Belgium - resides in some sort of climatological Narnia, its ADD skies totally unable to settle on a reliable behavior.<br />
<br />
A dry Friday turned into a thoroughly wet qualifying on Saturday. When Q3 had done, <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/nico+rosberg/">Nico Rosberg</a> would line up on pole position for the fourth race in a row for Mercedes AMG Petronas, after teammate <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/lewis+hamilton/">Lewis Hamilton</a> had another brake problem, this time glazing on one of the discs. <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/infiniti+red+bull+racing/">Infiniti Red Bull Racing</a> engineered a low-downforce setup and <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/sebastian+vettel/">Sebastian Vettel</a> took the best advantage, lining up third and making us wonder if the magic was back. <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/fernando+alonso/">Fernando Alonso</a> drove the first <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/ferrari/">Ferrari</a> to fourth, the Spaniard saying he thought a podium was possible. <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/daniel+ricciardo/">Daniel Ricciardo</a> put the second Infiniti Red Bull Racing in fifth, <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/valtteri+bottas/">Valtteri Bottas</a> behind him in the first <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/williams/">Williams</a>, then <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/kimi+raikkonen/">Kimi R&auml;ikk&ouml;nen</a> in the second Ferrari, <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/felipe+massa/">Felipe Massa</a> in the second Williams and <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/jenson+button/">Jenson Button</a> in the sole <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/mclaren/">McLaren</a> in the top ten.<br />

<a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/2015-subaru-wrx-s4/#photo-2869566"><img alt="Subaru WRX S4 rear three-quarter view" class="right border" data-credit="Subaru" data-mep="415422" src="http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/edad8de29d50186b26a1b4e205ef6e34/200635471/2015-subaru-wrx-s4-250.jpg" /></a>A <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/07/25/subaru-teasing-new-wrx-s4-model-japan-debut/">month after originally teasing</a> it, <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/subaru/">Subaru</a> is finally unveiling its <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/subaru/wrx/">WRX S4</a> model for Japan. It's a bit more than just a plush take on the sport sedan, because Subaru is fitting a more powerful version of the 2.0-liter, turbocharged boxer four-cylinder engine than we get on these shores.<br />
<br />
The company says that S4 stands for "'Sports performance', 'Safety performance', 'Smart driving' and 'Sophisticated feel," and it certainly looks like this Rex ticks all of those boxes. The most surprising feature is the Japanese model's 2.0-liter turbo engine boasting 296 horsepower (221 kilowatts) and 295 pound-feet (400 Newton-meters) of torque in this application. That's quite a healthy upgrade over the 268 hp and 258 lb-ft that Americans get in the standard WRX, and it's even nipping at the heels of the 305 hp and 290 lb-ft from the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/subaru/wrx+sti/">STI</a> with a 2.5-liter mill that we get over here.<br />
<br />
While extra power is always welcome, enthusiasts might not be so thrilled that Subaru's Sport Lineartronic Continuously Variable Transmission is the sedan's only available gearbox. However, it offers a simulated eight-speed shifting mode when drivers notch the car into Sport# driving mode. Of course, the S4 also packs Subie's trademark all-wheel drive with Vehicle Dynamics Control and Active Torque Vectoring as standard.<br />
<br />
Additional noteworthy differences include firmer steering box mounts for better feel and an electronic parking brake, a move that will likely delight commuters as it offends handbrake turn artists. The chassis and body have likewise received attention, with additional high-tensile steel and strengthened joints. Subaru says the bodywork as has actually been lightened in the process, though it isn't immediately clear how.<br />
<br />
Looking at the S4, the appearance differences are fairly minor compared to its US counterpart. The grille and lower air dam get completely filled in with silver mesh, and it has a somewhat different 18-inch wheel design. Inside, drivers are nestled into sport seats and grip a flat-bottom steering wheel. Red stitching and piano black trim finish off the interior looks to lend a sporty look.<br />
<br />
For improved safety, the company's latest Eyesight system boasts color recognition and a wider viewing angle than before. Systems like Pre-Collision Braking Control, Active Lane Keep steering assistance system and Adaptive Cruise Control are also available. <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/25/subaru-wrx-s4-revealed-jdm-power/#continued">Scroll down</a> to read Subaru's full announcement of this tech-packed WRX for Japan.<p><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/25/subaru-wrx-s4-revealed-jdm-power/" rel="bookmark">Continue reading <em>Subaru WRX S4 gets big power bump in Japan</em></a></p><p style="padding:5px;background:#ddd;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/25/subaru-wrx-s4-revealed-jdm-power/">Subaru WRX S4 gets big power bump in Japan</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.autoblog.com">Autoblog</a> on Mon, 25 Aug 2014 09:57:00 EST.

It's been a topsy-turvy summer for foreign businesses in China ever since that country's National Development and Reform Commission and State Administration for Industry &amp; Commerce launched a horde of investigations into anti-monopoly practices. When the law outlining monopolistic behavior was passed in 2008 foreign companies appreciated it, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/business/271950581.html">expecting it to illuminate</a> some of the more opaque corners of Chinese government enforcement. That hasn't exactly been the case, and now as <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2014-08/18/c_133564760.htm">more than 1,000</a> auto-sector firms get investigated <a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/china-fines-japanese-ball-bearing-maker-nsk-28-110119131.html">and pay huge fines</a> to settle the nebulous charge of having prices that are too high, that hoped-for clarity is all but gone.<br />

A recent news report said <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/audi/">Audi</a>, <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/chrysler/">Chrysler</a> and <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/daimler/">Daimler</a> "would be <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/08/08/toyota-says-chinese-anti-monopoly-regulators-looking-at-lexus-as-investigation/">punished for unspecified violations</a>" concerning the prices of spare parts. Earlier this month <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/toyota/">Toyota</a> said that <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/lexus/">Lexus</a> China <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-28703469">was being looked at</a>, and before there's been any public notification of punishment Lexus has decided to lower the price of its replacement parts. From next month, customers will save an average of 26 percent on roughly 15,000 parts. It's unknown whether the move will appease authorities enough to end the investigation, which outside analysts have said targets foreign firms in China over domestic industry.<p style="padding:5px;background:#ddd;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/25/lexus-parts-prices-cut-china/">Lexus parts prices cut in China amidst antitrust fears</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.autoblog.com">Autoblog</a> on Mon, 25 Aug 2014 09:14:00 EST.
