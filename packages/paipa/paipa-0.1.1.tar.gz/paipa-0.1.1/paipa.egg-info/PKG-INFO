        Overview
        --------
        
        What it does:
        
         - process stuff one step at a time
         - allows class based and function based steps
         - can scale steps independent of each other (manually)
         - don't do deadlocks
         - never expose the developer to the concept of a thread
           (if she doesn't like to)
         - run in finite batches where all threads are terminated at the end
         - run in continuous mode while being fed through a queue
         - automatically rate limit each step to minimize memory usage
         - terminate the pipeline in case of an Exception and propagate the error
           to the developer
        
        What it explicitly doesn't do (if it doesn't, it's not a bug!):
        
         - pipelines with multiple different parents. Multiple parents of
           the same type are handled automatically though.
         - auto-scale threads
         - bake bread
        
        What it shouldn't do (if it does, it's a bug!):
        
         - confuse the user/developer
         - hang on termination
         - hog resources
