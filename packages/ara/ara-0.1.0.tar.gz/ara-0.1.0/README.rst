ARA: Ansible Run Analysis
=========================
Important note
--------------
ARA is in very early development !
The documentation is definitely not thorough.

Please feel free to ask questions, provide feedback, comments, bugs, ideas,
suggestions or contributions !

tl;dr
-----
ARA_ is an attempt to make Ansible_ runs easier to visualize, understand and
troubleshoot.

It provides an Ansible callback to record playbook run data in a database and
a web interface built with Flask_ to browse that data.
