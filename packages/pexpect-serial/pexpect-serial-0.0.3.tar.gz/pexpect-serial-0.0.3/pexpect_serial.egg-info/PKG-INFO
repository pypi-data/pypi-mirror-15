Description: Introduction
        ------------
        
        This is like pexpect, but it will work with serial port that you
        pass it. You are reponsible for opening and close the serial port.
        This allows you to use Pexpect with Serial port which pyserial supports.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
            import serial
            from pexpect_serial import SerialSpawn
            ser = serial.Serial('COM1', 115200)
            ss = SerialSpawn(ser)
            ss.sendline('start')
            ss.expect('done')
