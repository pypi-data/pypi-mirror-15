        ------------------------------
        
          Qsctl(QingStor command line tool) provides more powerful unix-like commands.
          You can manage QingStor resources just like files on local machine. Unix-like
          commands contains: cp, ls, mb, mv, rm, rb, and sync. All of the them support
          batch processing.

          - virtualenv
        
            ```
            $ pip install qsctl
            ```
        
          - System-Wide
        
            ```
            $ sudo pip install qsctl
            ```
        
            On Windows systems, run it in a command-prompt window with administrator
            privileges, and leave out sudo.
        
        - Getting Started
        
          To use qsctl, there must be a configuration file to configure your own
          ``qy_access_key_id``, ``qy_secret_access_key``, and ``zone``, for example:
        
          ```
          qy_access_key_id: 'QINGCLOUDACCESSKEYID'
          qy_secret_access_key: 'QINGCLOUDSECRETACCESSKEYEXAMPLE'
          zone: 'pek3a'
          ```
        
          The configuration file is ``~/.qingcloud/config.yaml`` by default, it also
          can be specified by the parameter ``-c /path/to/config``.
