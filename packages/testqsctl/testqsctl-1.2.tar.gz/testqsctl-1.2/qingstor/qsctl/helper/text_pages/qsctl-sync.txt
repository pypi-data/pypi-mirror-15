NAME
       qsctl-sync

SYNOPSIS
       qsctl sync
	   <local-path> <qs-path> or <qs-path> <local-path>
	   [--delete]
	   [--exclude]
	   [--include]

DESCRIPTION
       Sync  between local directory and qs-directory. The first path argument
       is the source directory and second the destination directory.

       When a key or file already exists in the destination directory, program
       will  compare  the  modified  time  of source file(key) and destination
       key(file). The destination key(file) will be overwritten  only  if  the
       source file(key) is newer than destination one.

OPTIONS
       --delete
	   Any	files or keys existing under the destination directory but not
	   existing in the source directory will be deleted if --delete option
	   is specified.

       --include
	   Exclude all keys or files that match the specified pattern.

       --exclude
	   Do not exclude keys or files that match the specified pattern.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  sync  command  will sync current local directory to qs-
       directory:

	   $ qsctl sync . qs://mybucket

       Output:

	   Key <test1.txt> created
	   Key <test2.txt> created
	   Key <test3.txt> created

       The following sync command sync qs-directory to local directory:

	   $ qsctl sync qs://mybucket/test test

       Output:

	   File 'test/test1.txt' written
	   File 'test/test2.txt' written

       The following sync command with the --delete option will  delete  those
       files  existing in local directory but not existing in bucket mybucket.
       The local current directory has file test3.txt. The bucket mybucket has
       test1.txt and test2.txt:

	   $ qsctl cp qs://mybucket/myprefix -r --exclude "*.jpg"

       Output:

	   File 'test/test1.txt' written
	   File 'test/test2.txt' written
	   File 'test/test3.txt' deleted
