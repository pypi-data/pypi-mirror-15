Space API
=========

This library was started to better understand how Flight Dynamics works. It
has no intent of efficiency nor performance at the moment, and the goal is
mainly to develop a simple API for space observations.

The sources of this library can be found at [github](https://github.com/galactics/space-api)

Installation
------------

Space API only requires Python 3.5 and numpy. To install it use pip

    pip install space-api

Documentation
-------------

The documentation of the library can be found [here](http://space-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Usage
-----

You can find some usage in the official documentation at [this page](http://space-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest//examples.html).
