Introduction
============

This module implements new, configurable data types that are intended to be
used along with Py3o templates.

These data types should be used in the data source dictionary, as a
replacement to builtin (int, float...) and standard (date, time...) types.
Their rendering is based on a configuration that can be saved and loaded
as custom properties inside a ODF file.
