        Docuit is a tool which makes sure your README stays up to date and
        simplifies getting the needed parts out of the README.
        
        When working with multiple repositories, maybe different languages, the
        steps to ``build``, ``test``, ``run`` and ``deploy`` needs to be fetched
        to use the source. In good cases with a proper documentation it is
        sometimes tedious to find that over and over again.
        
        Docuit parses the README for the needed part prints them out ord can
        execute the steps right away.
        
        -  ``docuit check`` to make sure all necessary parts exist and prints
           out what is missing.
        -  ``docuit build|test|run|deploy`` Prints the content of the section.
        -  ``--exec`` flag will execute the steps.
        
        Using docuit makes sure all repositories have a similar README
        structure, simplifies using of the code and with the right setup can
        also simplify the continues deploy process: ``docuit deploy --exec``.
