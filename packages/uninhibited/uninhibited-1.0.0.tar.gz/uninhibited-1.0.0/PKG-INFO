Description: uninhibited
        ===========
        
        Dead simple event handling for Python; minus the straight jacket.
        
        * Extensible; Batteries included, not required.
        * Prioritized based handlers. Or `set`. Or `list`. Or any `iterable`.
        * Replacable container implementation.

        ----
        
        The code is simple, tiny, and straight forward including doctests.
        
        
        Async
        -----
        
        This is a rough as of yet, asynchronous iterators just aren't there yet in Python `3.5.1`.
        
        Python `3.5.2` (`rc1` at time of writing) happens to fix most of my grievances with them, however,
        so expect some changes here going forward.
