Description: ==============================================
        notes-py - Yet another static site generator.
        ==============================================
        
        notes-py is a *dumb* static site generator.  I use it to compile notes (duh) that I take about setting up packages or servers or w/e, to HTML so that I can serve them with apache and view them from any machine with internet access.  
        
        Fundamentally it uses https://github.com/rtfd/CommonMark-py to compile html from markdown files (like basically every other static site generator).
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Since notes-py is self contained (within notes-py/notes.py), you can just download and install this file somewhere in your path to use it.  It is also available on PyPI, so you should be able to install it with ``pip install notes-py`` as well.
        
        If installed with pip, it will also install an entry point at compile_notes, which behaves effectively as a link to notes_py.notes.
        
        Usage
        =====
        notes-py offers both a command line and programmatic interface.
        
        Command line
        ============
        To keep the command line options simple, the only thing you need to specify is the location of a configuration file::
        
          usage: compile_notes [-c path_to_config] [options]
        
          Options:
              -h, --help    : Print this help text
              -c, --config  : Specipy the path to a configuration file
              -V, --version : Print version and licence info
        
        Programmatic
        ============
        The full functionalitly (it isn't much) is available through the function at ``notes_py.notes.compile(content_path, compile_path, stylesheet, html_template)``.  If you are using notes-py programmatically then you should just read through the function to understand whatit does.
