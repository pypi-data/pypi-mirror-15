<p>Hi ${user.first_name},</p>

<p>Due to recent changes in the pricing policy of Heroku, our current hosting
provider, we are not able to keep hosting Yith Library there.</p>

<p>Fortunately we got a grant from Openshift.com and due to our open source
nature they are kind enough to give us free hosting! That's right, we will
continue as a free (as in beer) service.</p>

<p>We will migrating our service from Heroku to Openshift next Saturday June 28th
at 2:30 AM UTC and there will be a downtime of about 30 minutes.</p>

<p>The new URLs for the service will be:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.yithlibrary.com">https://www.yithlibrary.com</a> for the password server</li>
<li><a href="https://desktop.yithlibrary.com">https://desktop.yithlibrary.com</a> for the web client</li>
<li><a href="https://mobile.yithlibrary.com">https://mobile.yithlibrary.com</a> for the mobile client</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want yo can already use some of these URLs during the following days
and help us making sure these Openshift servers are working fine. But be
warned: any data you store in these servers will be lost on June 28th since
we will be loading the Openshift located database with the contents of the
Heroku one. After that day the Heroku servers will not be available anymore
and Openshift will become the official Yith Library instance.</p>

<p>Thanks for your patience and support!</p>

<p>- The Yith Library team</p>
