Description: # Proxy-Negotiate
        
        HTTP Negotiate (SPNEGO) proxy authentication support for applications. This
        allows applications that do not support HTTP proxies or do not support HTTP
        proxies with Negotiate authentication to allow them to safely traverse
        corporate firewalls without whitelisting IP addresses or MAC addresses and
        rather relying on secure user authentication. This tool is not intended to
        bypass firewall or proxy restrictions, in fact this tool was designed for better
        corporate security and centralized control.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install the easy way through PyPi:
        
            pip install proxy-negotiate
        
        Or alternatively download and build yourself:
        
        ```
           git clone https://github.com/cour4g3/proxy-negotiate
           cd proxy-negotiate
           python setup.py install
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### nc-negotiate
        
        A netcat-like implementation for use with programs such as SSH; now by simply
        using ProxyCommand, SSH can safely traverse the proxy through an HTTP CONNECT
        TCP tunnel.
        
            nc-negotiate host port [proxy_host] [proxy_port]
        
        Example of usage with openSSH:
        
        ```
        Host myexternalhost.com:
            ProxyCommand nc-negotiate %h %p
        ```
        
        ## Todo
        
        - Better parsing of the `http_proxy` and other proxy environment variables.
        - Implement a fake proxy to modify requests from applications that do not
          support HTTP Negotiate proxy authentication and pass it to the real proxy with
          the correct authentication header.
