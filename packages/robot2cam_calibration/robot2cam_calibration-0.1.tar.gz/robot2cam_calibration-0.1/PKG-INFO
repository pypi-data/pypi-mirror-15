        This library was designed to help us calibrate cameras to robots and to
        calibrate difficult end of arm objects (like say a car door, which isn't
        really a tool) to the robot flange. It uses error minimization to
        achieve this. The error comes from the euclidean and angular difference
        between a measured value and an estimate.
        
        We have built the library to handle two primary use cases which we have:
        
        1. Calibrating a UR robot to a flycapture2 enabled camera
        2. Calibrating an odd object (currently a door) mounted on the end of a
           KUKA arm.
        
        It would be great to have the system expanded in the future.
        
        Installing:
        -----------

        1. ``pip install robot2cam_calibration``
        2. Clone the repository and run ``python setup.py install``
