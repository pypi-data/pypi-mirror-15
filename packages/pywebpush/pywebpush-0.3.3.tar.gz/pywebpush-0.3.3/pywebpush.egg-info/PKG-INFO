        # Webpush Data encryption library for Python
        
        This is a work in progress.
        
        ## Installation
        
        You'll need to run `python virtualenv`.
        Then
        ```
        bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
        bin/python setup.py develop
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        In the browser, the promise handler for
        [registration.pushManager.subscribe()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushManager/subscribe)
        returns a
        [PushSubscription](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushSubscription)
        object. This object has a .toJSON() method that will return a JSON
        object that contains all the info we need to encrypt and push data.
        
        As illustration, a subscription info object may look like:
        ```
        {"endpoint": "https://updates.push.services.mozilla.com/push/v1/gAA...", "keys": {"auth": "k8J...", "p256dh": "BOr..."}}
        ```
        
        How you send the PushSubscription data to your backend, store it
        referenced to the user who requested it, and recall it when there's
        new a new push subscription update is left as an excerise for the
        reader.
        
        The data can be any serial content (string, bit array, serialized
        JSON, etc), but be sure that your receiving application is able to
        parse and understand it. (e.g. `data = "Mary had a little lamb."`)
        
        `headers` is a `dict`ionary of additional HTTP header values (e.g.
        [VAPID](https://github.com/mozilla-services/vapid/tree/master/python)
        self identification headers). It is optional and may be omitted.
        
        to send:
        ```
        WebPusher(subscription_info).send(data, headers)
        ```
        You can also simply encode the data to send later by calling
        
        ```
        encoded = WebPush(subscription_info).encode(data)
        ```
