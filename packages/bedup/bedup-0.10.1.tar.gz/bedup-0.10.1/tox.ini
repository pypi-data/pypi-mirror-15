# A workaround to prevent test discovery from finding the non-2to3 source.
# Even without 2to3, the pypy call above causes a build, and pytest
# can run into an import file mismatch between the build dir
# and the vcs dir.

# With PyPy, I'm not sure pip runs from the right interpreter.
# Re-run the install so as not to get root-owned files compiled live by CFFI.
