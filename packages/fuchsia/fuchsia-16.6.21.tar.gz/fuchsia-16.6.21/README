*Fuchsia* reduces differential equations for Feynman master integrals
to canonical form.

In concrete terms, let's say you have a system of differential
equations of this form:

    d/dx J = M(x, eps) * J,

where J is a column vector of unknown functions, M is a matrix of rational functions,
x is a free variable, and eps is an infinitesimal parameter

*Fuchsia* will, if possible, transform this system to an equivalent
Fuchsian system of this form:

    d/dx J' = eps * S(x) * J'

    where S(x) = Sum_i { S_i / (x - x_i) }

... with the transformation itself defined by matrix T like this:

    J = T * J'

Such a transformation is useful, because from it one can easily
find J' (and therefore J) as a series in eps.

You can learn about the algorithm *Fuchsia* uses to perform this
transformation from Roman Lee's paper at [1].

*Fuchsia* is available both as a command line utility and as a
(Python) library for SageMath [2]. It will run on most Unix-like
operating systems. You can learn about it's installation and
usage from [3].
