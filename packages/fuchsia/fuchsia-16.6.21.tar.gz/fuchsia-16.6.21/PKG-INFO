Description: *Fuchsia* reduces differential equations for Feynman master integrals
        to canonical form.
        
        In concrete terms, let's say you have a system of differential
        equations of this form:
        
            d/dx J = M(x, eps) * J,
        
        where J is a column vector of unknown functions, M is a matrix of rational functions,
        x is a free variable, and eps is an infinitesimal parameter
        
        *Fuchsia* will, if possible, transform this system to an equivalent
        Fuchsian system of this form:
        
            d/dx J' = eps * S(x) * J'
        
            where S(x) = Sum_i { S_i / (x - x_i) }
        
        ... with the transformation itself defined by matrix T like this:
        
            J = T * J'
        
        Such a transformation is useful, because from it one can easily
        find J' (and therefore J) as a series in eps.
        
        You can learn about the algorithm *Fuchsia* uses to perform this
        transformation from Roman Lee's paper at [1].
        
        *Fuchsia* is available both as a command line utility and as a
        (Python) library for SageMath [2]. It will run on most Unix-like
        operating systems. You can learn about it's installation and
        usage from [3].
