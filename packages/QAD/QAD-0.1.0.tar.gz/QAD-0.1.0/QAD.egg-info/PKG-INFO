Description: QAD
        =======================
        
        QAD is a quick and dirty web application scanner to pick up on low hanging
        fruit which may be beneficial to clients if mentioned in a pentest report.
        
        QAD is not multi-threaded and tries to be minimalist in output. It will
        process response headers, enumerate a small list of common (and potentially
        interesting) directories, and will advise if login or registration forms are
        available over a HTTP connection.
        
        ----
        
        This is the README file for the project.
        
        The file should use UTF-8 encoding and be written using ReStructured Text. It
        will be used to generate the project webpage on PyPI and will be displayed as
        the project homepage on common code-hosting services, and should be written for
        that purpose.
        
        Typical contents for this file would include an overview of the project, basic
        usage examples, etc. Generally, including the project changelog in here is not
        a good idea, although a simple "What's New" section for the most recent version
        may be appropriate.
