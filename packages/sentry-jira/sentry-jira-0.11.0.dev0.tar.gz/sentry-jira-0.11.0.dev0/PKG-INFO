        ===========
        
        A flexible extension for Sentry which allows you to create issues in JIRA based on sentry events.
        It is capable of rendering and saving many custom fields, and will display the proper fields depending on
        which issue type you are trying to create.
        
        **Requires Sentry 8+**
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install the package via ``pip``:
        
        ::
        
            pip install sentry-jira
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        Go to your project's configuration page (Dashboard -> [Project] -> Settings), select the
        Issue Tracking tab, and then click the JIRA button under available integrations.
        
        Enter the JIRA credentials and Project configuration and save changes. Filling out the form is
        a two step process (one to fill in data, one to enter additional options).
