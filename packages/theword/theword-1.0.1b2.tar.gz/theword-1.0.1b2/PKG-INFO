        =======
        
        |Build Status|
        
        Inspired by Python's ``import this``, `The
        Trashmen <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPrtFxd9u9Y>`__, and `The
        Family Guy <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNrx2jq184>`__, **theword**
        is a quirky library to answer that eternal question, "What's the word?"

        From any command line:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            $ pip install theword
        
        Emulating the Zen of Python

            _Surfin' Bird_, by The Trashmen
        
            A well a everybody's heard about the bird
            Bird, bird, bird, b-bird's the word
            A well a bird, bird, bird, b-bird's the word
            A well a bird, bird, bird, b-bird's the word
            A well a bird, bird, b-bird's the word
        
        General Usage
        -------------
        
        You can import any of the following:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from theword import TheWord, TheBird, what_is_the_word
        
        Ask the question:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            >>> what_is_the_word()
            <theword.theword.TheBird object at 0x10f582d90>   # Returns TheBird
            >>> what_is_the_word().answer
            '[E]verybody knows that the bird is the word!'
            >>> print what_is_the_word()  # We overloaded __str__
            {"answer": "[E]verybody knows that the bird is the word!", "question": "What's the word?", "id": "The Bird"}
        
        More quirky fun:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            >>> what_is_the_word().play()  # Turn on the volume, ensure your WiFi is on
            {'artist': 'The Trashmen', 'title': "Surfin' Bird", 'question': "What's the word?", 'released': 1964, 'answer': '[E]verybody knows that the bird is the word!', 'id': 'The Bird'}
            >>> what_is_the_word().celebrate() # Be prepared to laugh
            {'answer': '[E]verybody knows that the bird is the word!', 'celebrated_on': "FOX's The Family Guy", 'question': "What's the word?", 'id': 'The Bird', 'celebrated_by': 'Seth MacFarlane'}
            >>>
        
        If you watch all the skits you will recognize this:
        
            Sir, our math shows that the Bird is greater than or equal to the
            Word!
        
        .. code:: python
        
            >>> isinstance(TheBird(), TheWord)
            True
            >>> issubclass(TheBird, TheWord)
            True
