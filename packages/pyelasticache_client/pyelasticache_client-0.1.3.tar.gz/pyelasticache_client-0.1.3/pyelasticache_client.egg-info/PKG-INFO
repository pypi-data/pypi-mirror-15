        A comprehensive, fast, pure-Python memcached client with consistent key hashing 
        and node autodiscovery.
        Forked from the Pinterest pymemcache project:
        
        https://github.com/pinterest/pymemcache
        
        
        pyelasticache_client supports the following features:
        
        * Complete implementation of the memcached text protocol.
        * Configurable timeouts for socket connect and send/recv calls.
        * Access to the "noreply" flag, which can significantly increase the speed of writes.
        * Flexible, simple approach to serialization and deserialization.
        * The (optional) ability to treat network and memcached errors as cache misses.
        * Optional use of Ketama hashing to consistently distribute cache keys on nodes.
        * Automatic cluster nodes autodiscovery and update through the "config cluster" option
        
        Installing pyelasticache_client
        ===================================

        Usage
        =====

        Comparison with Other Libraries
        ===============================
        
        pylibmc
        -------
        
        The pylibmc library is a wrapper around libmemcached, implemented in C. It is
        fast, implements consistent hashing, the full memcached protocol and timeouts.
        It does not provide access to the "noreply" flag, and it doesn't provide a
        built-in API for serialization and deserialization. It also isn't pure Python,
        so using it with libraries like gevent is out of the question.
        
        Python-memcache
        ---------------
        
        The python-memcache library implements the entire memcached text protocol, has
        a single timeout for all socket calls and has a flexible approach to
        serialization and deserialization. It is also written entirely in Python, so
        it works well with libraries like gevent. However, it is tied to using thread
        locals, doesn't implement "noreply", can't treat errors as cache misses and is
        slower than both pylibmc and pymemcache. It is also tied to a specific method
        for handling clusters of memcached servers.
        
        memcache_client
        ---------------
        
        The team at mixpanel put together a pure Python memcached client as well. It
        has more fine grained support for socket timeouts, only connects to a single
        host. However, it doesn't support most of the memcached API (just get, set,
        delete and stats), doesn't support "noreply", has no serialization or
        deserialization support and can't treat errors as cache misses.
