Description: 
        Ductworks is an IPC library for Python, similar to the Pipe object from the multiprocessing library. Like Pipe,
        ductworks exposes a MessageDuct API with very simple send and receive semantics for end users (no worrying about
        streams, each send call corresponds to one recv call), while easily allowing for more flexible usage like having
        a communication channel between a parent python process and a python process in a child subprocess (separated by
        both fork(2) and exec(2)). As well ductworks allows users to freely choose their serialization library (and uses
        JSON by default) and uses regular BSD sockets; this makes connecting up programs in different languages (or even on
        different systems) relatively straightforward. Ductworks aims to make it simple to get socket pairs, when inheriting
        a anonymous socket pair is difficult or outright infeasible, and to make IPC easier and less stressful.
