        Installation
        ------------
        
        ::
        
            pip install -U pychurn
        
        pychurn will use the `pygit2` bindings for `libgit2` if available, which significantly improves performance. To install, see the `libgit2 docs <http://www.pygit2.org/install.html>`_.
        
        Usage
        -----
