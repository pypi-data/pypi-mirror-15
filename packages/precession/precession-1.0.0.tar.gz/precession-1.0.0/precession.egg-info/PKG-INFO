        DYNAMICS OF SPINNING BLACK-HOLE BINARIES WITH PYTHON
        ====================================================
        
        ``precession`` is an open-source Python module to study the dynamics of
        precessing black-hole binaries in the post-Newtonian regime. The code
        provides a comprehensive toolbox to (i) study the evolution of the
        black-hole spins along their precession cycles, (ii) perform
        gravitational-wave driven binary inspirals using both orbit-averaged and
        precession-averaged integrations, and (iii) predict the properties of
        the merger remnant through fitting formulae obtained from numerical
        relativity simulations. ``precession`` is a ready-to-use tool to add the
        black-hole spin dynamics to larger-scale numerical studies such as
        gravitational-wave parameter estimation codes, population synthesis
        models to predict gravitational-wave event rates, galaxy merger trees
        and cosmological simulations of structure formation. ``precession``
        provides fast and reliable integration methods to propagate statistical
        samples of black-hole binaries from/to large separations where they form
        to/from small separations where they become detectable, thus linking
        gravitational-wave observations of spinning black-hole binaries to their
        astrophysical formation history. The code is also a useful tool to
        compute initial parameters for numerical relativity simulations
        targeting specific precessing systems.

        INSTALLATION
        ------------
        
        ``precession`` works in python 2.x and has been tested on 2.7.10. It can
        be installed through `pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/precession>`__:
        
        ::
        
            pip install precession
        
        Prerequisites are ``numpy``, ``scipy`` and ``parmap``, which can be all
        installed through pip. Information on all code functions are available
        through Pyhton's built-in help system
        
        ::
        
            import precession
            help(precession.function)
        
        Several tests and tutorial are available in the submodule
        ``precession.test``. A detailed description of the functionalies of the
        code is provided in the scientific paper
        `arXiv:1605.01067 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01067>`__, where examples
        are also presented.
