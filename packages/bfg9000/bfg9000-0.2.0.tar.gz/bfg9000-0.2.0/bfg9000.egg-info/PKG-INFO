Description: bfg9000 - build file generator
        ==============================
        
        **bfg9000** is a cross-platform *build configuration system* with an
        emphasis on making it easy to define how to build your software. It
        converts a Python-based build script into the appropriate files for your
        underlying build system of choice (Ninja, Make, or MSBuild).
        
        Why bfg9000?
        ------------
        
        Already familiar
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        ``build.bfg`` files are just Python scripts with some new functions
        added, so you may already know how to write them; and when your build
        gets complicated, you can rely on the existing Python ecosystem to get
        you out of trouble.
        
        Build fast
        ^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Python may be slow, but bfg9000 gets out of the way as quickly as
        possible and relies on existing, mature build systems like Make and
        Ninja to do the heavy lifting of building your software.
        
        Stay sane
        ^^^^^^^^^
        
        Building your code shouldn't be the hard part of developing your
        project. Above all else, bfg9000 strives to make it easy to write your
        build scripts.
        
        A brief example
        ---------------
        
        You can't get much simpler than the simplest ``build.bfg`` file:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            executable('simple', files=['simple.cpp'])
        
        To build this executable, we need to create the actual build files and
        then run them:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            $ cd /path/to/src/
            $ 9k build/
            $ cd build/
            $ ninja
        
        From there, you can run your newly-created executable: ``./simple``.
        Hooray!
        
        For further examples, please see the
        ```examples/`` <https://github.com/jimporter/bfg9000/tree/master/examples>`__
        subdirectory.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        bfg9000 uses `setuptools <https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/>`__, so
        installation is much the same as any other Python package:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            $ pip install bfg9000
        
        From there, you can start using bfg to build your software! For more
        information about how to install bfg9000, see the
        `documentation <https://jimporter.github.io/bfg9000/install>`__.
