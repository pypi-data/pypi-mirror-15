        ======================================
        
        Scrapy Eagle is a tool that allow us to run any Scrapy based project in a distributed fashion and monitor how it is going on and how many resources it is consuming on each server.
        
        **This project is Under Development, don't use it yet**
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        It could be easily made by running the code bellow,
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ pip install scrapy-eagle
            
        You should create one ``configparser`` configuration file (e.g. in /etc/scrapy-eagle.ini) containing:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            [redis]
            host = 10.10.10.10
            port = 6379
            db = 0
            
        Then you will be able to execute the `eagle_server` command like,
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            eagle_server --config=/etc/scrapy-eagle.ini
