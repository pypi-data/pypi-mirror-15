class BarabasiAlbert(Graph):
    r"""
    Create a random Barabasi-Albert graph.

    The Barabasi-Albert graph is constructed by connecting nodes in two steps.
    First, m0 nodes are connected at random. Then, nodes are added one by one.
    Each node is connected to m of the older nodes with a probability distribution
    depending of the node-degrees of the other nodes:
    ::
        p_n(i) = \frac{k_i}{\sum_j{k_j}}
    ::

    For the moment, we set m0 = m = 1.

    Parameters
    ----------
    N : int
        Number of nodes (default is 1000)
    m0 : int
        Number of initial nodes (default is 1)
    m : int
        Number of connections at each step (default is 1)
        m can never be larger than m0.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from pygsp import graphs
    >>> G = graphs.BarabasiAlbert(500)
