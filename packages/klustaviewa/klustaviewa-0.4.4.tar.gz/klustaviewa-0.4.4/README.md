# KlustaViewa

**NOTE**: this project will be replaced by [phy](https://github.com/kwikteam/phy) in the near future.

**KlustaViewa** is a graphical interface for the manual stage of spike sorting.

It is part of the [KlustaSuite](https://github.com/kwikteam/klusta). Refer to this project for installation instructions.

## Documentation

There is a [user guide here](https://github.com/klusta-team/klustaviewa/blob/master/docs/manual.md) but it is quite old, so some instructions refer to a previous version.
