Transcrypt is a tool to precompile a fairly extensive subset of Python into compact, readable Javascript. It has the following characteristics:

- Allows for classical OO programming with *multiple inheritance* using pure Python syntax, parsed by CPython's native parser
- Seamless integration with the universe of high-quality web-oriented JavaScript libraries, rather than the desktop-oriented Python ones
- Hierarchical URL based module system to prevent name conflicts
- Simple relation between Python source and generated JavaScript code for easy debugging
- Multi-level sourcemaps and optional annotation of target code with source references
- Compact downloads, kB's rather than MB's
- Lightning fast JavaScript code, using memoization (call caching) to optionally bypass the prototype lookup chain
- Operator overloading can be switched on and off locally to facilitate use for numerical math that's both readable and efficient

Documentation with code examples
================================

Take a look at the documentation with code examples at the Transcrypt website: http://www.transcrypt.org .

Status
======

Second release:

- Multi-level sourcemaps, annotated target code, virtualenv installation.
- Automated tests of functionality of compiled code OK.
- Reasonable amount of manual testing of the use of sourcemaps done by author.
- Further tests and feedback very welcome, especially of the source maps part.
- Sourcemaps were tested on Chrome under Windows and Linux, but seem to work on Firefox under Linux as well.

What's new
==========

- Python math module added
- Live on-line SVG based turtle graphics added to website + demo's
- Turtle graphics improved and expanded
- SVG based turtle graphics module added
- Multiple module initialization bug fixed
- Alias py_name (in JS) for name (in Python) added
- Installation procedure changed to benefit from virtualenv
- Optional annotation of target code with source file names and source line numbers
- Multi-level sourcemaps: Python source level debugging of both formatted and minified JavaScript code
- Source code included in map rather than separate as was the case earlier
- Switched from sectored V3 sourcemaps to monolithic V3 sourcemaps since they seem more mature and accepted

Known restrictions
==================

- No standard libs, use or encapsulate the JavaScript ones, that's part of the concept. Some may be ported though.
- Not all methods of builtin types are there by default. This results from a deliberate choice to keep Transcrypt lean. Such things can be distributed in separate libs.
- No eval and exec of Python code. This is again part of the concept. Transcrypt code is compiled, optimized and minified in advance to warant fast page loads.
- No threading of any kind. Will probably stay that way as long as JavaScript doesn't properly support that.
- No iterator, generator, xrange stuff. Maybe in the future if a broadly installed version of JavaScript suppports it.

Known bugs
==========

- None

Readability
===========

As can be seen below, there's a simple parallel between the Python and the JavaScript code.
So it should be easy to debug.
Also, code can be tested from the command prompt using stubs.
