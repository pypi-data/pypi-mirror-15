Description: Varsity
        =======
        
        Varsity helps you define your application's settings, read them from
        environment variables, parse them into native Python types, and validate
        them.
        
        Load a simple string
        --------------------
        
        Assume the FOO environment variable as been set to '3'. Here we define a
        loader, use it to give our 'foo' setting a name, and tie it to the 'FOO'
        environment variable. We get back a dictionary with a key for each
        setting we've added to the loader.
        
        ::
        
            >>> from varsity import Loader
            >>> 
            >>> l = Loader()
            >>> l.add('foo', 'FOO')
            >>> settings = l.load()
            >>> settings['foo']
            '3'
        
        The object returned from .load() also provides attribute-style access to
        settings.
        
        ::
        
            >>> settings.foo
            '3'
        
        You can provide a 'typ' callable that will be used to convert the
        environment variable string into the type of your choice.
        
        ::
        
            >>> l.add('foo', 'FOO', typ=int)
            >>> settings = l.load()
            >>> settings.foo
            3
        
        You can provide defaults that will be returned if the environment
        variable is not present.
        
        ::
        
            >>> l.add('some_unset_var', 'SOME_UNSET_VAR', default=0)
            >>> settings = l.load()
            >>> settings.some_unset_var
            0
        
        If you don't provide a default, and the environment variable is not set,
        ValueError will be raised.
        
        You can provide your own callable as the 'typ' argument. Assume the
        'TODAY' environment variable is set to '2016-05-05'.
        
        ::
        
            >>> from varsity import Loader
            >>> from iso8601 import parse_date
            >>> l = Loader()
            >>> l.add('today', 'TODAY', typ=lambda x: parse_date(x).date())
            >>> settings = l.load()
            >>> settings.today
            datetime.date(2016, 5, 5)
        
        If you don't provide a 'typ', but you do provide a default, then the
        environment variable will be cast to the same type as the default. (Here
        we get back an int 3 instead of the string '3', because the default is
        an int.)
        
        ::
        
            >>> l.add('foo', 'FOO', default=0)
            >>> settings = l.load()
            >>> settings.foo
            3
        
        If you access a setting with the attribute-style syntax, then nested
        dictionaries can also be accessed with that syntax. In this example, the
        FOO environment variable is set to '{"bar": {"baz": 1.23}}'
        
        ::
        
            >>> l.add('foo', 'FOO', typ=json.loads)
            >>> settings = l.load()
            >>> settings.foo.bar.baz
            1.23
