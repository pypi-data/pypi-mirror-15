            Command line tool to interact with the BitShares network
        
            positional arguments:
              {set,addkey,listkeys,listaccounts,getbalance,transfer,approve}
                                    sub-command help
                set                 Set configuration
                addkey              Add a new key to the wallet
                listkeys            List available keys in your wallet
                listaccounts        List available accounts in your wallet
                getbalance          Get balances of available account(s)
                transfer            Transfer funds from your wallet to someone else
                approve             approve funds from your wallet to someone else
        
            optional arguments:
              -h, --help            show this help message and exit
              --node NODE           Websocket URL for public BitShares API (default: "wss://bitshares.openledger.info/ws")
              --rpcuser RPCUSER     Websocket user if authentication is required
              --rpcpassword RPCPASSWORD
                                    Websocket password if authentication is required
              --nobroadcast         Do not broadcast anything
        
        ### Adding keys
        
        airsign comes with its own encrypted wallet to which keys need to be added:
        
            airsign addkey <posting-wif-key>
        
        On first run, you will be asked to provide a new passphrase that you
        will need to provide every time you want to post on the BitShares network.
        If you chose an *empty* password, your keys will be stored in plain text
        which allows automated posting but exposes your private key to your
        local user.
        
        ### List available Keys and accounts
        
            airsign listkeys
        
        This command will give the list of public keys to which the private keys
        are available.
        
            airsign listaccounts
        
        This command tries to resolve the public keys into account names registered
        on the network (experimental).
        
        ### Get Balances
        
        The command `getbalance` only takes optional arguments if you want to
        see the balance of a specific account, else it will show all balances
        for which a key has been added to the wallet (see above)
        
            $ airsign getbalance
            Please unlock your existing wallet!
            Passphrase: 
            wallet.xeroc:
            +-------------+----------+
            | Amount      | Asset    |
            +-------------+----------+
            | 61557.53766 | BTS      |
            | 1e-07       | OPEN.BTC |
            | 107.5035    | MKR      |
            +-------------+----------+
            live-coding:
            +------------+-------+
            | Amount     | Asset |
            +------------+-------+
            | 9993.84531 | BTS   |
            +------------+-------+
        
        ### Transfer
        
        Transfers can be initiated from any account for which the *active key*
        is installed. The `--amount` parameter can be applied several times to
        send different assets from the same origin to the same recepient. The
        command supports encrypted memos. If your account has a distinct memo
        key (usually identical to the active key), then you need to add that key
        to your wallet aswell.
        
            airsign transfer --from <fromaccount> --to <recepient> --amount "1 USD" --amount "2 BTS" --memo <Text>
        
        The global `--nobroadcast` flag can be added before `transfer` to
        prevent airsign to broadcast the transaction to the BitShares network:
        
            airsign --nobroadcast transfer --from <fromaccount> --to <recepient> --amount "1 USD" --amount "2 BTS" --memo <Text>
        
        ### Approval of Proposals
        
        Any proposal can be approved using airsign:
        
            airsign approve <proposal-id>
        
        The default account will be used, unless stated otherwise with
        an `--account` parameter. The proposal-id must habe the form `1.10.x`.
