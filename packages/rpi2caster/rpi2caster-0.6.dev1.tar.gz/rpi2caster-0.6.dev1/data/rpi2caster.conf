[Interface]

# Signals arrangement for use with the consecutive pins on the I2C interface
#
# You can arrange your signals as you wish and make connections accordingly.
# Just choose one of these arrangements for the "signal_arrangement" option
# in your interface section. You can also define a new one.
#
# mcp0 is the MCP23017 with lower address (e.g. 0x20), mcp1 - the chip
# with higher address (e.g. 0x21). If you're using DIP or SOIC chips,
# I/O bank A uses physical pin numbers 21...18, bank B is 1...8.
# See datasheet for further info."""
#
#   "alphanum" arrangement - alphanumerically, numbers first, O+15 last:
#
#    mcp0 bank A | mcp0 bank B                | mcp1 bank A | mcp1 bank B
#    ---------------------------------------------------------------------
#    12345678    | 9 10 11 12 13 14 0005 0075 | ABCDEFGH    | IJKLMN S O15

#   "monotype" arrangement - according to Monotype code order on paper tower:
#
#    mcp0 bank A | mcp0 bank B     | mcp1 bank A | mcp1 bank B
#    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

#    "pcb-beta1" - for rpi2caster interfaces in beta stage of development
#    (John Cornelisse, Book Art Museum and Heavy Metal Letterpress have those)
#    The air connection bar has 15 lines above and 14 below.
#    Valves are: 1 - lower left, 2 - lower right, 3 - upper right, 4 - upper left.

#    mcp0 bank A  | mcp0 bank B       | mcp1 bank A      | mcp1 bank B

# Select one of the above arrangements by using the like:
# "signals = %(NAME)s
# Of course you can define your own
signals = %(pcb-beta1)s


# Control parameters:
#
# Specify GPIO numbers for the controls related to system
# (poweroff button, reboot button, ready LED)
# These parameters will be read by the gpiodaemon program,
# which also sets up the interrupt handling for sensor
# and emergency stop button inputs (these things have to
# be done with root privileges - and rpi2caster is meant
# to run under regular user account).
led_gpio=18
shutdown_gpio=24
reboot_gpio=23


# Specify the caster control backend to use
# Sensor and output can be selected individually
# (allows for more flexibility)
sensor=sysfs
output=wiringpi



[Database]

# Database parameters:
#
# The type and access path of a database, in which all workshop
# inventory is stored (i.e. wedges, diecases, matrix data).
# Currently, only SQLite3 is supported,
# but there is a possibility of adding local or remote MySQL db
# (especially on Raspi 2 or newer, which has more processing power
# and can run a "heavyweight" MySQL server).
# This would be useful for large printshops using several casters
# with individual interfaces - with a centralized database
# to store all the diecase data etc.
type=sqlite3
path=/var/local/rpi2caster/rpi2caster.db



[Preferences]

# Specify default line length for composition, sorts and spaces
# This can always be overridden during runtime
# Measured in units set below
default_measure=20


# Specify the typographic measurement unit
# Different countries, and even typesetters, use various units
# Supported units:
#    dd - European Didot point
#    cc - cicero (=12dd, .1776")
#    ff - Fournier point
#    cf - Fournier cicero (=12ff, .1628")
#    pp - TeX / US printer\'s pica point
#    Pp - TeX / US printer\'s pica (=12pp, .1660")
#    pt - DTP / PostScript point = 1/72"
#    pc - DTP / PostScript pica (=12pt, .1667")
#    ", in - inch
#    mm - millimeter
#    cm - centimeter
measurement_unit='cc'


# Specify if you want to choose between simulation and actual casting
# Recommended for parallel interfaces
choose_backend=yes
