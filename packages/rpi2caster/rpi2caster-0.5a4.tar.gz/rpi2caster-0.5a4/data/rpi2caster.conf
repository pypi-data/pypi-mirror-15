[SignalsArrangements]
# You can arrange your signals as you wish and make connections accordingly.
# Just choose one of these arrangements for the "signal_arrangement" option
# in your interface section. You can also define a new one.

# mcp0 is the MCP23017 with lower address (e.g. 0x20), mcp1 - the chip
# with higher address (e.g. 0x21). If you're using DIP or SOIC chips,
# I/O bank A uses physical pin numbers 21...18, bank B is 1...8.
# See datasheet for further info."""

#   "alphanum" arrangement - alphanumerically, numbers first, O+15 last:
#
#    mcp0 bank A | mcp0 bank B                | mcp1 bank A | mcp1 bank B
#    ---------------------------------------------------------------------
#    12345678    | 9 10 11 12 13 14 0005 0075 | ABCDEFGH    | IJKLMN S O15

#   "monotype" arrangement - according to Monotype code order on paper tower:
#
#    mcp0 bank A | mcp0 bank B     | mcp1 bank A | mcp1 bank B
#    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#    NMLKJIHG    | F S ED 0075 CBA | 12345678    | 9 10 11 12 13 14 0005 O15

#    "pcb-beta1" - for rpi2caster interfaces in beta stage of development
#    (John Cornelisse, Book Art Museum and Heavy Metal Letterpress have those)
#    The air connection bar has 15 lines above and 14 below.
#    Valves are: 1 - lower left, 2 - lower right, 3 - upper right, 4 - upper left.
#
#    mcp0 bank A  | mcp0 bank B       | mcp1 bank A      | mcp1 bank B

[Control]
# Control parameters:
#
# Specify GPIO numbers for the controls related to system
# (poweroff button, reboot button, ready LED)
# These parameters will be read by the gpiodaemon program,
# which also sets up the interrupt handling for sensor
# and emergency stop button inputs (these things have to
# be done with root privileges - and rpi2caster is meant
# to run under regular user account).

led_gpio=18
shutdown_gpio=24
reboot_gpio=23


[Database]
# Database parameters:
#
# The type and access path of a database, in which all workshop
# inventory is stored (i.e. wedges, diecases, matrix data).
# Currently, only SQLite3 is supported,
# but there is a possibility of adding local or remote MySQL db
# (especially on Raspi 2 or newer, which has more processing power
# and can run a "heavyweight" MySQL server).
# This would be useful for large printshops using several casters
# with individual interfaces - with a centralized database
# to store all the diecase data etc.

type=sqlite3
path=/var/local/rpi2caster/rpi2caster.db
