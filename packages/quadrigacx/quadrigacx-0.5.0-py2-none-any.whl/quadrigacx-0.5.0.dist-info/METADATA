Python QuadrigaCX
=================

quadrigacx is a Python wrapper for the `QuadrigaCX API
(v2) <https://www.quadrigacx.com/api_info>`__.

Install
-------

``pip install quadrigacx`` [might not be available yet]

or ``pip install setup.py`` in the repo's main directory after you
download this repo.

Configuration
-------------

You will need to create a config file in order to use the authenticated
API actions. Use sample.cfg in the config folder

Usage
-----

The actual interface is still in flux, so bear with me while I don't
explain how to use it for the moment. If you really want to use it, poke
around (it's pretty simple); but don't be surprised when it breaks
later.

It also apparently relies on a package that isn't yet (and don't really
plan to make) public, so there is also that stopping you.
