NeutronPy is a collection of commonly needed tools aimed at facilitating the
analysis of neutron scattering data. NeutronPy is built primarily using the
numpy and scipy python libraries, with minor contributions from the kapteyn
library (least-squares fitting based on the C-implementation of MPFIT), and
a rewrite of ResLib 3.4c (MatLab) routines for Instrument resolution
calculations.
