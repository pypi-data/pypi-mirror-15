sphinxserve is a tool to effectively document projects
======================================================

Since the internet adopted HTML, many communities are trying to find ways to
write web pages in ways that can be pleasantly readable and writable. In our
python community, `reStructuredText`_ and `Sphinx`_ have been created to author
beautiful documentation. The goal of sphinxserve is to make them more
accessible, interactive, and convenient to use.

Design considerations
=====================

sphinxserve was originally conceived as a Python and Linux project that can
visualize sphinx document modifications in real time while working on them. At
its core, sphinxserve uses the awesome projects `gevent`_  to provide
concurrency and event coordination, `bottle`_ for web communication,
`watchdog`_ for filesystem events, `Sphinx`_ for reStructucturedText rendering
and of course `Python`_.

History
=======

release 0.8: sphinxserve fully supports python3. bottle replaces flask and
ajax long polling replaces websockets to simplify even more the web server
logic.

release 0.7.4: sphinxserve is able to run in other platforms as OSX and Windows
for example.

release 0.7: sphinxserve decoupled from xdotool using flask-sockets python
package. The tradeoff was to temporarily drop python3 support until the gevent
ecosystem officially supported python3. Also, the filesystem notification tool
was upgraded to watchdog, removing another system dependency and making the
code more generic and cleaner.

release <0.7: sphinxserve used to control browser reloading with xdotool,
a complex system tool dependency only available on Unix systems and tested
on Linux.

Installation
============

sphinxserve can be installed either as a `python package`_, or as a `docker`_
application. On linux and OSX, it can also be installed as a pex
`python executable`_

.. _python package: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinxserve
.. _docker app: https://hub.docker.com/r/mzdaniel/sphinxserve
.. _Python executable: https://github.com/mzdaniel/sphinxserve/releases


Python executable (PEX)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the easiest (no compilation or fancy tooling needed) and smallest
(~9 MB) way to install sphinxserve using the excellent `PEX`_ tool. In itself,
it is a zipfile containing all python package dependencies and only requires
the python interpreter. This pex is verified to work at least in Debian>=7,
Ubuntu>=14, Centos>=7 and Arch distros on Linux and in Yosemite on OSX.

Linux
-----

System dependencies: glibc linux>=3, python>=2.7 and a web browser
supporting websockets (Firefox, Chrome, etc) on Linux::

    $ wget -O ~/bin/sphinxserve https://github.com/mzdaniel/sphinxserve/releases/download/0.7.5/sphinxserve-linux
    $ chmod 755 ~/bin/sphinxserve

OSX
---

Yosemite already has all needed dependencies::

    $ wget -O ~/bin/sphinxserve https://github.com/mzdaniel/sphinxserve/releases/download/0.7.5/sphinxserve-osx
    $ chmod 755 ~/bin/sphinxserve


Python package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Linux system dependencies: glibc linux>=3, python>=2.7, the C toolchain
(package names dependent on linux distro) to compile gevent and a web browser
supporting javascript. pip automatically downloads sphinxserve and its python
dependencies, compiles and builds wheel binary packages as needed and finally
install sphinxserve.

OSX system dependencies: Verified to work on Yosemite, python >=2.7 and
a web browser supporting javascript ajax with just pip installing.

Windows system dependencies: Verified to work on Windows 7, python >=2.7 and
a web browser supporting javascript ajax with just pip installing.

In all systems::

    $ pip install sphinxserve


Docker application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Docker`_ is an extraordinary tool that simplifies the entire dependency tree
by including it in a system image. This makes the installation experience
much more pleasant and the ability to run on OSX, Windows and Linux with the
same image, assuming proper setup of the docker network and volume. Another
advantage is that a running image cannot see your filesystem by default.
Sharing directories and which ones is an explicit setup. This method is
verified to work on Linux so far.

System dependencies: docker and a web browser supporting websockets.

This installation command automatically downloads sphinxserve image (~40 MB)
and creates a small shell script ~/bin/sphinxserve that simplifies the running
interface with the following command::

    $ docker run mzdaniel/sphinxserve install | bash


Launching
=========

Launching sphinxserve is as simple as::

    $ sphinxserve [OPTIONAL_SPHINX_PATH]

By default, it assumes the sphinx project is in the current directory. A
sphinx project needs to have the configuration file conf.py, and if not found,
sphinxserve will automatically create 2 new files: conf.py and a
restructuredtext index.rst.

To change host and/or port, and other options, check the help with::

    $ sphinxserve serve --help


Workflow
========

After launching sphinxserve, it will build the sphinx pages and serve them
by default on localhost:8888. To see the rendered documentation, just point
your browser to localhost:8888. Any saved changes on rst or txt files will
trigger docs rebuild.


Local test/build
================

Assumptions for this section: A unix system, python2.7, 3.4 or 3.5, and
pip >= 8.1. Although git is recommended, it is not required.

We use tox to test sphinxserve in virtualenvs for python2.7, 3.4 and 3.5
Tox is a generic virtualenv manager and test command line tool. It handles the
creation of virtualenvs with proper python dependencies for testing, pep8
checking and building:

    $ git clone https://github.com/mzdaniel/sphinxserve; cd sphinxserve
    $ pip install tox
    $ tox
