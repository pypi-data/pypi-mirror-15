Welcome to GeoMath's documentation!
===================================

GeoMath is a Mathematical Library for Python 3.X that tries to solve every problem included in the Analytical Geometry field, you can use in any of your apps for getting several calculus done in miliseconds.

The library is Object Oriented and it's very simple to use(as we used the KISS - Keep it Simple, Stupid - Standards), to use the library you need some instances like ``Point`` or ``Line`` or even a ``Figure``, that will help you saving time and getting things done quickly.

A single script can solve as many problems as you want, but keep in mind that you will do this scripts, but the library will give all the resources needed to do it.

The project is named `GeoMath` as a tribute to all the mathematicians that worked with the geometry field, during this milleniums.

Installation
------------

There are two simple ways to get GeoMath installed and running on your computer:

1. from Python PyPi
2. from github(not recommended)


Installing from PyPi
--------------------

To install GeoMath from PyPi, first, you have to make sure that you have ``pip`` installed in your computer. With it installed, you just need to run:

```
pip install geomath
```

If everything goes fine with your installation, you just installed GeoMath and you can use it in Python.



Installing from Github
----------------------

Since GeoMath is under beta stages and during a very hard development state, installing GeoMath from it should not be a great idea. If you want to get the most stable version of the library you should install it via ``pip``.

To install the library from Github, you must run this command:

```
$ git clone https://www.github.com/vmesel/GeoMath.git
```

After that, you should move GeoMath to the libraries folder in Python, so you can import it from any system.

Done! Now you can use GeoMath!
