Contributing to GeoMath
=======================

As we are an open source library, we want everyone to interact with our content and suggest things to improve in our system. While the library is up and running, you will see updates and everything that can help you to develop more complex system solving apps.
But to continue to improve, we need your help! Our initial development team is working on things for the library and for other projects, so if you want to help, here is a guide that you must follow to contribute.


----------------------
Contribution Guideline
----------------------

Everything you put to work on this library is valid as a contribution, but for the commit get approve, it must follow some simple rules.


*Coded Contributions:*


- You must have documented the changes you have made in the docs, so we can see what you implemented and changed
- You must comment in your code, so it can be readable for everyone that is going to use


If you don't want to contribute with code, you can donate for us some money, translate the library for your language, or even create a logo, so we won't be an ugly library.

---------------------
Contributions Needed
---------------------

We are looking after for some types of contributors:

- Mathematicians or anyone who loves geometry
- Beta testers for new functions
- Anyone who have any knowledge building GUIs for Apps in Python
- Design for a Logo
