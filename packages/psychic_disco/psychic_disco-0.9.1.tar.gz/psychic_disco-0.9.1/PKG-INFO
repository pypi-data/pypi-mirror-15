Description: Psychic Disco
        -----------------------------------
        
        - Are you a poor dope with a program to deploy? 
        - Need to produce a demo, but haven't yet hit pay dirt?
        - Love python development, but not product delivery?
        
        Then let Psychic Disco be your principal delegate for publicly displaying your work!
        
        By leveraging the pioneering domains of AWS Lambda and the Serverless Web, Psychic Disco allows even plebian dummies like you and I to scale the platforms of our dreams on the cheap.

        Installing
        ----------
        
        Install like so::
        
         pip install psychic_disco
        
        Assumptions
        -----------
        
         * All your microservices live in python modules
         * All your entrypoints are decorated with @lambda_entry_point
        
        Declaring Entrypoints and API methods
        -------------------------------------
        Make a new entrypoint::
        
          @lambda_entry_point
          def handler(event, context):
            # important code here
        
        Making a new api method automatically registers the entrypoint::
        
          @api_method("POST", "/cereal"):
          def create_cereal(event, context):
            # cereal creation logic here
        
        Definitions for your API methods are available in ``psychic_disco.Api``.
        
        Discovering Entrypoints
        -----------------------
        
        Do this thing::
        
          psychic_disco discover_entrypoints
        
        Or, if your code lives elsewhere::
        
          psychic_disco --repo path/to/st/elsewhere discover_entrypoints
        
        Creating a Deployment Package
        -----------------------------
        Do this thing::
        
          psychic_disco bundle
        
        That will make a virtualenv, install your dependencies, and zip it all up for you. This assumes that you have ``psychic_disco.config.default_s3_bucket`` defined in your ``psychic_disco_config.py``
        
        Deploying Lambda Functions
        --------------------------
        Once a deployment package has been uploaded to Amazon S3, you can install the lambda functions you defined like so::
        
          psychic_disco deploy_lambdas
        
        This assumes that you have ``psychic_disco.config.default_iam_role`` defined in your ``psychic_disco_config.py``
        
        Querying AWS
        ------------
        You can see what has already been configured on AWS by running::
        
          psychic_disoc show_installed_routes <api-name>
        
        Which will output something like:
        
        ===== ======= ================
        verb  path    lambda-function
        ===== ======= ================
        GET   /users  users-list_all
        POST  /users  users-create_new
        PATCH /user/7 users-update
        ===== ======= ================
        
Platform: UNKNOWN
