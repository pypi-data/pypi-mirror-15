= Installing from source =

To install GRR from source you first need to make sure you have the necessary
dependencies.  The easy way to get them is to install them as packages using the
link:quickstart.adoc[quickstart] script like this:

----
git clone https://github.com/google/grr.git
cd grr
sudo bash scripts/install_script_ubuntu.sh -dy
----

The hard way is to do it all from
scratch using the link:serverfromscratch.adoc[server from scratch] instructions.

Once you have the dependencies, install GRR itself and follow any further instructions from the script:
-------------------------------------------------------
sudo bash scripts/install_server_from_src.sh
-------------------------------------------------------
