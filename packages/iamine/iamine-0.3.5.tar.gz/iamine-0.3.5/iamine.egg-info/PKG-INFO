        How Do I Get Started?
        =====================
        
        
        Command Line Interface
        ----------------------
        
        The IA Mine command line tool should work on any Unix-like operating
        system that has Python 3 installed on it. To start using ``ia-mine``,
        simply download one of the latest binaries from
        `https://archive.org/details/iamine-pex
        <https://archive.org/details/iamine-pex>`_.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            # Download ia-mine and make it executable.
            $ curl -LO https://archive.org/download/iamine-pex/ia-mine
            $ chmod +x ia-mine
            $ ./ia-mine --help
            ...
        
        Usage:
        
        .. code::
        
            $ ia-mine --help
            Concurrently retrieve metadata from Archive.org items.
        
            usage: ia-mine (<itemlist> | -) [--debug] [--workers WORKERS] [--cache]
                           [--retries RETRIES] [--secure] [--hosts HOSTS]
                   ia-mine [--all | --search QUERY] [[--info | --info --field FIELD...]
                           |--num-found | --mine-ids | --field FIELD... | --itemlist]
                           [--debug] [--rows ROWS] [--workers WORKERS] [--cache]
                           [--retries RETRIES] [--secure] [--hosts HOSTS]
                   ia-mine [-h | --version | --configure]
        
            positional arguments:
              itemlist              A file containing Archive.org identifiers, one per
                                    line, for which to retrieve metadata from. If no
                                    itemlist is provided, identifiers will be read from
                                    stdin.
        
            optional arguments:
              -h, --help            Show this help message and exit.
              -v, --version         Show program's version number and exit.
              --configure           Configure ia-mine to use your Archive.org credentials.
              -d, --debug           Turn on verbose logging [default: False]
              -a, --all             Mine all indexed items.
              -s, --search QUERY    Mine search results. For help formatting your query,
                                    see: https://archive.org/advancedsearch.php
              -m, --mine-ids        Mine items returned from search results.
                                    [default: False]
              -i, --info            Print search result response header to stdout and exit.
              -f, --field FIELD     Fields to include in search results.
              -i, --itemlist        Print identifiers only to stdout. [default: False]
              -n, --num-found       Print the number of items found for the given search
                                    query.
              --rows ROWS           The number of rows to return for each request made to
                                    the Archive.org Advancedsearch API. On slower networks,
                                    it may be useful to use a lower value, and on faster
                                    networks, a higher value. [default: 50]
              -w, --workers WORKERS
                                    The maximum number of tasks to run at once.
                                    [default: 100]
              -c, --cache           Cache item metadata on Archive.org. Items are not
                                    cached are not cached by default.
              -r, --retries RETRIES
                                    The maximum number of retries for each item.
                                    [default: 10]
              --secure              Use HTTPS. HTTP is used by default.
              -H, --hosts HOSTS     A file containing a list of hosts to shuffle through.
        
        
        Python Library
        --------------
        
        The IA Mine Python library can be installed with pip:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            # Create a Python 3 virtualenv, and install iamine.
            $ virtualenv --python=python3 venv
            $ . venv/bin/activate
            $ pip install iamine
        
        This will also install the ``ia-mine`` comand line tool into your virtualenv:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ which ia-mine
            /home/user/venv/bin/ia-mine
        
        
        Data Mining with IA Mine and jq
        ===============================
        
        ``ia-mine`` simply retrieves metadata and search results concurrently
        from Archive.org, and dumps the JSON returned to stdout and any error
        messages to stderr. Mining the JSON dumped to stdout can be done using a
        tool like `jq <http://stedolan.github.io/jq/>`_, for example. jq
        binaries can be downloaded at `http://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/
        <http://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/>`_.
        
        ``ia-mine`` can mine Archive.org search results, the items returned from
        search results, or items provide via an itemlist or stdin.

        ---------------
        
        0.3.5 (2016-05-24)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        **Features and Improvements**
        
        - Fixed ``Exception ignored in:`` errors.
        - Added support for custom config files.
        
        0.3.3 (2015-08-04)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        **Bugfixes**
        
        -  Added HISTORY.rst to MANIFEST.in to fix `pip install iamine`.
        
        0.3.2 (2015-08-03)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        **Bugfixes**
        
        -  ``asyncio.JoinableQueue`` was deprecated in Python 3.4.4.
           ``iamine.core.Miner`` now uses ``asyncio.Queue`` for Python 3.4.4 and
           newer and ``asyncio.JoinableQueue`` for older versions
           (``asyncio.Queue`` cannot be used for all versions because
           ``asyncio.Queue.join()`` was only added in version 3.4.4.).
        -  ``SearchMiner.get_search_info()`` is no longer a coroutine (now uses
           ``urllib``). Fixed bug in ``iamine.api.search`` where it was still
           being called as coroutine.
