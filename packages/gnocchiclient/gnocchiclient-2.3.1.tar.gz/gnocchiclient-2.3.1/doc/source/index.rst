Python bindings to the Gnocchi API
========================================================

This is a client for gnocchi API. There's :doc:`a Python API
<api>` (the :mod:`gnocchiclient` module), and a :doc:`command-line script
<shell>` (installed as :program:`gnocchi`). Each implements the entire
Gnocchi API.

    You may want to read the `Gnocchi Developer Guide`__  -- the overview, at
    least -- to get an idea of the concepts. By understanding the concepts
    this library should make more sense.
