Description: `aenum` includes the new Python stdlib enum module available in Python 3.4
        backported for previous versions of Python from 2.7 and 3.3+
        tested on 2.7, and 3.3+
        
        
        An `Enum` is a set of symbolic names (members) bound to unique, constant
        values.  Within an enumeration, the members can be compared by identity, and
        the enumeration itself can be iterated over.
        
        A `NamedTuple` is a class-based, fixed-length tuple with a name for each
        possible position accessible using attribute-access notation.
        
        A `NamedConstant` is a class whose members cannot be rebound;  it lacks all other
        `Enum` capabilities, however; consequently, it can have duplicate values.
        There is also a `module` function that can insert the `NamedConstant` class
        into `sys.modules` where it will appear to be a module whose top-level
        names cannot be rebound.
