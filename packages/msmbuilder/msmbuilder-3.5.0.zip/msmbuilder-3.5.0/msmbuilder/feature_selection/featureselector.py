    """Concatenates results of multiple feature extraction objects.

    This estimator applies a list of feature_extraction objects then
    concatenates the results. This is useful to combine several feature
    extraction mechanisms into a single transformer.

    Note: Users should consider using `msmbuilder.preprocessing.StandardScaler`
    to normalize their data after combining feature sets.

    Parameters
    ----------
    features : list of (str, msmbuilder.feature_extraction) tuples
        List of feature_extraction objects to be applied to the data.
        The first half of each tuple is the name of the feature_extraction.
    which_feat : list or str
        Either a string or a list of strings of features to include in the
        transformer.
