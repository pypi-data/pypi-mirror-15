Description: \ 
        h5browse (formerly dataviz) is a utility for browsing HDF5 files.
        
        It was developed for analyzing neuronal simulation data saved in a
        custom format. But the interface is generic enough to display simple
        HDF5 files. The tools are totally for neuronal data analysis. But the
        plan is to make it a more general tool.
        
        As of 2015-12-21, it supports displaying the tree structure of an HDF5
        file, node attributes and dataset contents. You can select arbitrary
        fields in a dataset for displaying X-Y plots.
        
        Implementation of editing HDF5 is incomplete.
        
        Note that being based on h5py library it inherits the limitations of
        the same.
        
        This is a rewrite of the old code. Replaced PyQwt with
        PyQtGraph. Written from scratch in Python 3. Compatible with
        Python2.7.
