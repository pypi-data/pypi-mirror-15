Description: Consistent versioning for NatCap Projects
        =========================================
        
        This package provides a consistent versioning scheme for projects of the
        Natural Capital Project (http://naturalcapitalproject.org).
        
        Versioning Scheme
        =================
        
        How a version string is formatted: ::
        
            If we are at a tag:
                version = {tag}
            else:
                version = {tag}.post{N}+r{nodeid|short}
        
            If there are no tags:
                {tag} = 'null'
        
        
        Examples:
        
         * **Version string** = ``3.4.5``
        
           * Meaning: This version of this tool was built from the tag ``3.4.5``.
        
           * You can update to this revision by calling ``hg update -r 3.4.5``
        
         * **Version string =** ``3.4.5.post35+r788a29c99234``
        
           * Meaning: This version of this tool was built from a revision where:
        
             * The latest tag was ``3.4.5``
        
             * The latest commit on this branch is ``35`` commits beyond the latest tag.
        
             * The latest commit has a shortened node ID of ``788a29c99234``
        
           * You can update to this revision by calling ``hg update -r 788a29c99234``
        
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        **Via pip:** ``pip install natcap.versioner``
        
        **Via setup.py:** ``python setup.py install``
        
        .. note ::
            If you install ``natcap.versioner`` via pip or via setup.py, dependencies
            should install automatically.
        
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        To install dependency: ::
        
             pip install setuptools
        
        
        Usage In Your Project
        =====================
        
        To use this project, you'll need to edit two files: ``setup.py`` and ``__init__.py``.
        
        
        **In your ``setup.py``**
        
        Adding these lines to your ``setup.py`` allows the DVCS information to be
        fetched from ``git`` or ``hg`` and recorded in the package metadata.
        
        ::
        
            from setuptools import setup
            import natcap.versioner
        
            setup(
                name='example_project',
                ...
                version=natcap.versioner.parse_version()
                natcap_version='example_project/version.py',
            )
        
        
        **In your package's ``__init__.py``** 
        
        Adding these lines to your package's ``__init__.py`` file will allow the package
        version to be fetched from the package metadata.
        
        ::
        
            # Let's assume your package name is still 'example_project'
            import natcap.versioner
            __version__ = natcap.versioner.get_version('example_project')
        
        Support
        =======
        
        If something doesn't work, it's probably broken!
        Please submit an issue via the issue tracker, send James an email
        or stop by if you're in the office and I'll try to fix it!
        
        Tests
        =====
        
        To run the suite of tests: ::
        
            $ python setup.py nosetests
        
        Note that ``hg`` and ``git`` must be available as executables on the command-line.
        
        
        
        
        0.4.0
        =====
        * Removing dependency on ``pyyaml``.
        * Adding ``__version__`` attribute to ``natcap.versioner``.
        
        0.3.3
        =====
        * Tests now have full coverage of the package.
        * Git repositories without branches are now correctly handled.
        * Errors encountered in calls to ``hg`` and ``git`` command-line applications
          will cause ``subprocess.CalledProcessError`` to be raised.
        
        0.3.2
        =====
        * Setting setuptools ``zip_safe=True``.  After a review of the module, it
          appears that no functionality within ``natcap.versioner`` requires access to
          resources within the package via the filesystem.
        
        0.3.1
        =====
        * Restoring support for installation as egg (0.3.0 lacked this).
        * Minor stylistic changes for PEP8 and PEP257
        
        0.3.0
        =====
        * Adding support for git.
        * Added tests for core versioning functionality.
        
        0.2.4
        =====
        * Allowing get_version() to allow fallback to SCM only when allowed by user
          input.  Defaults to only allowing fallback in non-frozen environments (e.g. a
          source tree).  ``natcap.versioner.VersionNotFound`` will be raised if the version
          string cannot be loaded normally or SCM is disallowed.
        * If a version string cannot be parsed by vcs_version(),
          ``natcap.versioner.VersionNotFound`` will optionally be raised.
        
        0.2.3
        =====
        * Turning setuptools zip_safe flag to False.  When this and natcap.invest have their zip_safe
          flags all as False, the packages happily install side-by-side as individual eggs.
        
        0.2.2
        =====
        * Fixes an issue where a development version is returned when the user is at a tag.  The 
          version is now correctly reported as just the tag.
        
        0.2.1
        =====
        * Version files are now properly imported.  This fixes an issue with users unable to fetch
          version strings from within frozen environments that are outside of a source tree.
        
        0.2.0
        =====
        * API Change: version is now parsed from setup.py using ``natcap.versioner.parse_version()``.
        * Allowing the version to be correctly fetched from PKG-INFO from egg/distribution metadata even when the package has not already been built.
        
        0.1.4
        =====
        * Attempting to get the utils module to import correctly.
        
        0.1.3
        =====
        * Allowing version string to be written to a package file.
        
        0.1.2
        =====
        * Default version scheme is dvcs-based post-release now. but can also do a pre-release.
        
        0.1.1
        =====
        * Fixes installation issues where certain files needed for setup.py were missing from the source distribution.
        
        0.1.0
        =====
        * Initial public release.
