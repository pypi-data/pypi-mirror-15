What is yac?
------------

*  A workflow system that does for services what docker did for applications

    *  docker helped make it easy to find, run, define, and share individual applications
    *  yac does the same for services
    
*  A cli app that lets you easily find, run, define, and share service templates

    *  yac registry works just like the docker registry
    *  services are defined as templates in json
    *  services templates can be browsed, and instantiated via the yac registry

*  A happy place for service developers, cloud administrators, and service providers

What is a service?
------------------

*  An application that provides some useful function
*  An application that can be implemented using one of more cloud service
