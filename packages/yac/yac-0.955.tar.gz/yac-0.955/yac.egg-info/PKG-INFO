        What is yac?
        ------------
        
        *  A workflow system that does for services what docker did for applications
        
            *  docker helped make it easy to find, run, define, and share individual applications
            *  yac does the same for services
            
        *  A cli app that lets you easily find, run, define, and share service templates
        
            *  yac registry works just like the docker registry
            *  services are defined as templates in json
            *  services templates can be browsed, and instantiated via the yac registry
        
        *  A happy place for service developers, cloud administrators, and service providers
        
        What is a service?
        ------------------
        
        *  An application that provides some useful function
        *  An application that can be implemented using one of more cloud service
