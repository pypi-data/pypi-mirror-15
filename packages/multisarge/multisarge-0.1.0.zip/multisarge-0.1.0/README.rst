===========

Multiprocessing Task Runner Using Sarge
---------------------------------------

Multi-Sarge a simple mix of the Python multiprocessing library's process pool and Sarge_'s command runner to orchestrate running many commands at one time.

Look at the `cowsay_runner` example for a good idea of how to use it.

TODO
