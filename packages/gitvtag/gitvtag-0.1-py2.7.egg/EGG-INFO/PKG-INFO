Description: # git vtag
        Simple and straightforward version tagging with Git. Version tags are tags in 
        the following format:
        
              v<major>.<release>.<build>
             
        (actually, the number of the components can be variable, we are only 
        dealing with the last component)
          
        ## Installing
        To install the released version:
        
              > pip install git-vtag
        
        ## Running
        The command has built-in help:
        
              > git vtag
        
        ## Development version
        To install the code in development mode:
        
              > git clone <git-repository-address>
              > cd git-vtag
              > python setup.py develop
        
        **Tip**: if you are using virtual environment and autoenv, you may want to set up the .env file, for example:
        
            env_dir=./.venv
            echo activate $env_dir
            source $env_dir/bin/activate`
