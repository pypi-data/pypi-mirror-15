git vtag
========

Simple and straightforward version tagging with Git. Version tags are
tags in the following format:

      v<major>.<release>.<build>


(actually, the number of the components can be variable, we are only
dealing with the last component)

Installing
----------

To install the released version:

::

      > pip install gitvtag

Running
-------

The command has built-in help:

::

      > git vtag

Development version

To install the code in development mode:

::

      > git clone https://github.com/SashaOv/git-vtag.git

**Tip**: if you are using virtual environment and autoenv, you may want
to set up the .env file, for example:
