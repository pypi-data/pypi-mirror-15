[red]*Disclaimer: This interface is not certified for use in an HPSS production
environment to store/retrieve production (valued) data! +
It has not been extensively tested, and is still early in development. +
Only for use on a dedicated SwiftOnHPSS development system!*

This document is meant to provide general instruction on the installation and
configuration of a stand-alone Swift node running SwiftOnHPSS.

[[X1]]
Working Assumptions
-------------------
This guide assumes a good working knowledge of:

* OpenStack Swift
* OpenStack Keystone
* HPSS administration
* Basic Linux system administration

This guide also makes assumptions on your:

* Client machine: running RHEL 7.1 on a reasonably modern x86-64 processor,
  with Internet access for the duration of the install and LAN connectivity
  to the HPSS core and movers at all times.
* HPSS installation: HPSS 7.4.3p2 or newer, using UNIX authentication with
  local or system passwd files
* OpenStack infrastructure: that there exists a Keystone server already,
  configured with a service tenant and 'swift' service account.


[[X2]]
Initial Considerations
----------------------
Contact your HPSS support representative for copies of the FUSE driver and
client RPMs for the specific version of HPSS that is running on your site. We
have only tested with HPSS FUSE 2.01 and newer.

Install the HPSS client and HPSS FUSE. This machine will run a stand-alone
Swift node with SwiftOnHPSS.

Add a 'swift' service user in HPSS and on the client machine:

----
 # adduser swift
 # /opt/hpss/bin/hpss_unix_user add swift
----

Next, create a few FUSE mount points. For the account and container servers, 
create a local directory (we have it at /srv/swift/hpss_meta) and use FUSE to
mount it to a directory in HPSS (we use /swift/meta). For the object
server, we're using /srv/swift/hpss to mount /swift/objects. Specific
commands are as shown below.

[WARNING]
.Choose the classes of service carefully!
===============================================================================
For the Swift metadata mount point, be sure to choose a COS that:

* Is geared towards 'small' files
* Has a migration policy to tape, AND
* [red]*Does not purge anything from disk!*

Otherwise, Swift will not perform very well at all if not accessed for some
time!

For the Swift object mount point, choose a COS that can accept a wide range
of file sizes. Migration and purge policies and storage hierarchy can be
as desired.
===============================================================================

Install Prerequisites for SwiftOnHPSS
-------------------------------------
It's recommended to install 'pip', which is a Python package management tool.
That can be found at https://pip.pypa.io:

----
# wget https://pip.pypa.io/get-pip.py
# python get-pip.py
----

Install memcached, start the service and make it run on startup.

----
# yum install memcached python-memcached
# service memcached start
# systemctl enable memcached
----


[[X4]]
Install Keystone (if not already existing)
------------------------------------------
Install OpenStack Keystone, and deploy it following
this guide: https://docs.openstack.org/kilo/install-guide/yum/content/keystone-install.html

This does not have to be on the same machine that SwiftOnHPSS is on, but it does
need to be installed on an HPSS client machine if the HPSS Keystone driver is
desired to use HPSS identities with Swift.

After installing Keystone and verifying that it works using that guide,
create the service entity and API endpoint, but don't create any users or
projects yet if the HPSS-specific Keystone backend is desired.

If it is desired, install the HPSS Keystone backend, and configure
/etc/keystone/keystone.conf to use it as the sole identity provider.

----
# cd /opt/openstack
# git clone https://github.com/hpss-collaboration/hpss-keystone-driver
# cd hpss-keystone-driver
# pip install -r requirements.txt
# python setup.py develop
----

./etc/keystone/keystone.conf
----

[identity]
driver = hpss_keystone.identity.Identity

----


[[X5]]
Install and Configure SwiftOnHPSS
---------------------------------
We have tested SwiftOnHPSS against the Kilo stable release of Swift.
Download the Kilo release of Swift (https://launchpad.net/swift/juno/2.2.0, or
more optimally from https://github.com/openstack/swift) and install it.
Additionally, install the 'keystonemiddleware' library using Pip if you are
using Keystone.

----
# mkdir /opt/openstack
# cd /opt/openstack
# git clone https://github.com/openstack/swift stable/kilo
# git clone https://github.com/openstack/keystone stable/kilo
# git clone https://github.com/hpss-collaboration/swiftonhpss
# pip install keystonemiddleware
# pip install -r swift/requirements.txt
# pip install -r swift/setup_requirements.txt
# pip install -r keystone/requirements.txt
# cd swiftonhpss
# python setup.py develop
----

Contact your HPSS support representative for the 'hpss', 'hpssfs' and
'swiftonhpss' Python libraries appropriate for your site's version of HPSS.
Upon receipt of those libraries, install them. Assuming the libraries are in
/opt/hpss_lib:

----
# cd /opt/hpss_lib
# python hpssfs/setup.py install
# python hpsspy/setup.py install
# pip install -r swiftonhpss/prereqs.txt
# python swiftonhpss/setup.py develop
----

Copy the sample configuration files over from the 'etc' folder of the Swift
installation over to /etc/swift, and remove the extra account and object
server configurations.

----
# cp -r doc/saio/etc/ /etc/swift

# rm /etc/swift/account-server/2.conf
# rm /etc/swift/account-server/3.conf
# rm /etc/swift/account-server/4.conf

# rm /etc/swift/container-server/2.conf
# rm /etc/swift/container-server/3.conf
# rm /etc/swift/container-server/4.conf

# rm /etc/swift/object-server/2.conf
# rm /etc/swift/object-server/3.conf
# rm /etc/swift/object-server/4.conf
----

Then go through each one of the remaining account, container, and object
configuration files and change them as so:

After editing the configuration scripts, it is time to generate the Swift
server rings. There is a script to automate doing this in
doc/saio/bin/remakerings that could be used, but it needs some modification
to fit the recommended configuration.

Next, configure rsyslog for Swift. Swift comes with a perfectly usable
example configuration, so just copy it over.

----
# cp doc/saio/rsyslog.d/10-swift.conf /etc/rsyslog.d/10-swift.conf
# service syslog restart
----

Start up the Swift server, and make sure that it is accessible and works
properly.

----
# swift-init main start
----

[[X6]]
Where To Go From Here
---------------------

At this point, the SwiftOnHPSS archive machine is fully configured and ready
to develop on and use for experimental purposes.

A command-line client can be had by installing the "python-openstackclient"
package with 'pip'. If Keystone is in use, then in order to log into Swift it
is necessary to create a Swift service user in Keystone and grant it the
'admin' role in the 'service' project in the default domain, and also to add
the Swift URL to the service endpoint catalog.

SwiftOnHPSS now has a tool to synchronize changes made through other HPSS
interfaces with the Swift metadata databases, called 'swiftonhpss-nstool'.
It is included in the SwiftOnHPSS Git repository, and should have been
automatically installed along with the rest of the system.

For further reading on how the Swift object storage system works and how to do
further customization, see:
https://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/index.html
