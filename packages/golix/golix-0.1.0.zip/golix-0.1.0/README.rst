Why PyCryptoDome over cryptography.io?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I would much prefer to be using PyCA's cryptography.io project for my
crypto backend, but currently I cannot.

These are reasons why the pycryptodome and cryptography.io projects are
on more or less the same initial footing, with a slight advantage to
cryptography.io:

-  Most of the complaints cryptography.io lists as their raison d'etre
   are also solved by PyCryptoDome:

   -  PyPy, py3 support: **check**
   -  Maintenance: **check**
   -  Implementations vulnerable to side-channel attacks: based off
      pycrypto, so *maybe*, but I'm not qualified enough to comment
      here. However, our threat model is such that compromising the host
      machine is considered (basically) full compromise of the
      cryptosystem, so this is pushing outside the scope of py\_golix,
      *at least for now*.
   -  API improvements: Ehhhh, I have complaints, to be sure, but once
      I've started using it, it isn't that bad (for the most part).
   -  Algorithm availability, ex GCM, HKDF: **check**
   -  Introspectability / testability: somewhat unqualified to comment,
      largely because I haven't taken the time to verify, but
      pycryptodome does a lot of testing, so inclined to be optimistic
      here
   -  Error-prone APIs: I haven't had an issue here
   -  Bad defaults: conversations on the github repo with the primary
      dev behind pycryptodome indicate a reasonably intelligent amount
      of thought being put behind defaults.

-  That being said, cryptography.io *is* more mature, *is* more widely
   used, and *does* have a larger, and potentially-better-pedigreed list
   of maintainers

   -  It's difficult for me to do due diligence on Legrandin, the
      maintainer of PyCryptoDome, because I have very little public info
      to go off of. I very much respect that, but I'm limited to then
      doing things like googling (his? I *think* Helder is a masculine
      name but I'm not sure) email address, username, and name. I've
      read a number of contributions and discussion threads from that,
      but beyond that I don't have a ton to go on.
   -  The team behind cryptography.io is very well-respected.

-  Neither library supports 100% of the cryptographic primitives Golix
   needs to work
-  Both projects install easily from pip
-  Neither project has completed a third-party audit.

**However,** these problems *currently* tip the scales in support of
PyCryptoDome:

-  **cryptography.io signing API doesn't appear to allow pre-generation
   of hashes to sign (critical).** This is "needed" for the GHID; even
   though we could appropriately slice the data and then pass it to be
   signed, we would have to repeat the hash generation process
-  **cryptography.io doesn't support OAEP+MGF1+SHA512 (critical).** Yes,
   this is an extremely unusual construction, but the Golix standard has
   a STRONG desire to minimize the number of crypto primitives
   (including hash functions) necessary to support the standard. Maybe
   in the future that will change.
-  cryptography.io doesn't support SIV mode (note that SIV may be
   removed from Golix standard, though)
-  cryptography.io doesn't support scrypt
-  PyCryptoDome has fewer dependencies

   -  In particular, it doesn't rely upon openssl for cross-platform use
   -  I believe cryptography.io is trying to move away from that, but
      it's causing me deployment issues already, just while
      experimenting with the two libraries.

And these metrics are unknown:

-  Less complexity = better maintainability, and especially given fewer
   dependencies, easier third-party audit if necessary

   -  cryptography.io: 993229 SLOC as of 16 Feb 2016 (this is wholly
      inaccurate; it includes documentation)
   -  PyCryptoDome: 300648 SLOC as of 16 Feb 2016 (this is wholly
      inaccurate; it includes documentation)
   -  cryptography.io churn rate roughly 4x project SLOC
   -  Pycryptodome churn rate roughly 2x project SLOC

Todo (no particular order)
==========================

-  DOCUMENTATION.
-  Ensure immutability of all objects that define ``__hash__``
-  Packed lowlevel objects should probably be immutable.
-  Reassess return API for receiving things as a FirstPersonID. Should
   it return a tuple, as it is right now, or not? Should the object
   return be different from the payload return? Unpacking extracts
   pretty much everything you can get that's not protected by crypto.
   **I think probably transition API to "unpack" for the object,
   "receive" for the content.** And then receive will always return a
   single item.
-  Change hash generation to use hash.update method, and then finally
   call a .finalize
-  Test vectors for all crypto operations
-  Need ThirdPartyID for servers

   -  Cannot create anything
   -  Has no keys
   -  Copies most of the methods from FirstPartyID for unpacking, etc
   -  Can also verify objects

-  Should EVERYONE verify the entire dynamic chain (particularly re:
   consistent author), or just servers? Probably everyone. Which means
   that needs to be added. Except, because that is a state preservation
   issue, that needs to be handled downstream.
-  Consider wrapping all parsing errors in SecurityError
-  Consider adding functionality to prevent access to attributes on ex.
   static bindings when loading a packed object until the object has
   been verified with receive\_.

Done
----

-  [STRIKEOUT:Make handling of GHID objects symmetric. AKA, convert
   loaded SmartyParseObjects into utils.Ghid objects.] That was
   unexpectedly straightforward.
-  ~~Move trashtest into \_spec unit test file before substantial
   changes.~~ Might have broken since then though.
