Description: # Serbus
        
        Copyright (c) 2015 - Gray Cat Labs - https://graycat.io
        
        Serbus provides basic C APIs for the I2C and SPI serial bus protocols on 
        GNU/Linux based systems, as well as a Python package built on top of them. 
        
        It's really just a wrapper for the ioctl commands provided by the standard Linux 
        I2C and SPI drivers, so it should be pretty universal. That said, I've currently
        only tested it extensively on the BeagleBone Black, so use it at your own risk! 
        (And let me know if it's working for you on another system)
