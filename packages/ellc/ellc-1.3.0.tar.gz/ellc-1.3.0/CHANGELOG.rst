Version sent to A&A

1.1.0 (2016-05-11)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Changed definition of third-light contribution to be more intuitive.

1.2.0 (2016-05-11)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Added clean exit if polynomial root finding step fails in ell_ell_intersect,
 and raised warning for cases where results may be inaccurate due to
 root-polishing convergence problems.

1.3.0 (2016-05-11)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Added test to catch rare case in module ellipse, subroutine ell_ell_intersect
 where test for tangent/intersection point fails because one of the mid-points 
 between the intersection/tangent points is also a tangent point (or nearly 
 so).
