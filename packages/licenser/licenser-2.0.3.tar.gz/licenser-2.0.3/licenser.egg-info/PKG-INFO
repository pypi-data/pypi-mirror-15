        Finding and adding a license to your project is an annoying process,
        and can be quite tedious depending on the license you choose.
        
        Licenser allows you to quickly add a license to your project from
        the command line. Supported licenses can be found in the
        [assets folder](https://github.com/tylucaskelley/licenser/tree/master/licenser/assets).

        to suggest the addition of other licenses!
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
        * Python 2.7 or Python 3.5
        
        ### Installation
        
        ```bash
            $ pip install licenser
        ```
        
        Alternatively, grab the
        [zip](https://github.com/tylucaskelley/licenser/tarball/v2.0.3)!
        
        ### Usage
        
        From the command line:
        
        ```bash
        $ licenser -n "Your Name" -e "you@example.com" -l "license name" -p "project name"
        ```
        
        Name, email, and license are the three required parameters; project will default
        to the current directory name if you don't include it.
        
        `--txt` will add the `.txt` extension to the `LICENSE` file.
        
        ### Configuration
        
        If you're like me and don't change your name very often, you can save time by
        storing your defaults for name, email, and license in `~/.licenser`:
        
        ```bash
        name="Your Name"
        email="you@example.com"
        license="MIT"
        ```
        
        ### Contributing
        
        I accept [pull requests](https://github.com/tylucaskelley/licenser/compare)!
        There are some potential improvements I've been thinking about:
        
        1. Prepending headers to source code files for licenses that recommend it
        2. Pull licenses from an online API (maybe)
        3. Support for more licenses
        
        **Tip**: While working on a feature or bug, you can test your script by running
        `python licenser` from the root project directory.
        
        Additionally, make sure that all tests pass when you add features, and write
        new unit tests if you add a function. Tests can be run using the `nosetests`
        command from the root project directory.
