Welcome to PyBlue
=================

- - -

A simple static site generator. Zero configuration. Works with any existing site.

PyBlue allows the reuse of data and visuals (header/footer) across many pages
and it can generate static sites from dynamic templates.

This page was created with PyBlue from the file located in <a href="https://github.com/ialbert/pyblue/tree/master/docs/index.html">docs/index.html</a>.

### Why PyBlue?

There is no shortage of static html generators. PyBlue is a personal project
that aims to address my personal annoyances with other options. I have evaluated
quite a few alternatives even used some options over longer periods
of time. Neither of the choices did everything I needed for my work.
Hence came the motivation to write my own static site generator.

The following are some of the reasons why PyBlue exists:

1. Pyblue requires no initial configuration, special file naming scheme to get started.
1. Pyblue will work with existing html files. Every feature is optional!
1. Automatic linking!  Pyblue can be told to produce correct links automatically.
1. Reorganize the site at any time without having to worry about broken links.
1. Pyblue can embed and syntax highlight code.
1. Pyblue integrates seamlessly with Markdown.
1. Pyblue can be told to load data into any page. The template system can operate on this data.
1. Advanced templating [Django Templating][django] system and all that it offers.
1. Tiny codebase. PyBlue is around 500 lines of code. Runs on Python 2.7 and 3.4 as well.

### Install

    pip install pyblue --upgrade

Or download it from the [PyBlue at PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyblue/).
Alternatively to install the latest version:

    git clone git@github.com:ialbert/pyblue.git
    cd pyblue
    python setup.py develop

- - -

### Usage

* Launch pyblue to serve a directory <code>pyblue -r docs</code>.
* View your site by visiting <code>http:://localhost:8080</code>.
* Edit your pages and make changes. Reload the page to see your edits live.
* Finally, generate static output with: <code>pyblue -r docs -o html</code>

To see extra help on options run: `pyblue -h`

### Features

- - -

#### Context

The pages are rendered through the [Django Template][django_templates] language.
To make use of the templating you need to understand how this templating language works.

There is extra data associated with each  page.
For example the
{% verbatim %}<code>{{ page }}</code>{% endverbatim %} variable is available:

* Writing: {% verbatim %}<code>{{ page.name }}</code>{% endverbatim %} will produce: {{ page.name }}
* Writing: {% verbatim %} <code>{{ page.last_modified }}</code> {% endverbatim %}
  will produce: {{ page.last_modified }}
* Writing: {% verbatim %} <code>{{ page.size|filesizeformat }}</code> {% endverbatim %}
  will produce: {{ page.size|filesizeformat }}

Note how in this last case we also made use of the <code>filesizeformat</code> builtin filter of Django.
Users may add more information even load a python module into the page.

More details on the {% link "context.html" %} page.

#### Links

Users can also make use of pyblue specific template tags that are
automatically available. For exmple `link` is such a tag that generates
the proper relative path to any other template or file.

* {% verbatim %}<code>{% link "context.html" %}</code>{% endverbatim %} will
produce the following: {% link "context.html" %}.

* {% verbatim %}<code>{% link "context.html" text="Click the context now!" %}</code>{% endverbatim %} will
produce the following: {% link "context.html" text="Click the context now!" %}.

Important: Note how in this case the file is located in <code>info/context.html</code> Yet we did not have
to put that into the linking tag. `PyBlue` found the file and linked it properly

How does that work? The {% verbatim %}<code>{% link "context.html" %}</code>{% endverbatim %}
command performs a regular expression search on all files in the directory and
once it finds a match it produces a link to it with the proper relative path.
This keeps links correct even if the files were to be moved later.

Note that the search string is a regular expression that does not need a full path to the file.
It is sufficient to specify the shortest unambiguous part of the filename `PyBlue` will find
it and link it.

As a matter of fact this is one reason PyBlue was written. I got very tired of broken links
after a more logical reorganization of my sites. That is not a problem now.

#### Markdown

To include markdown content place it between
{% verbatim %}`{% markdown %}` and `{% endmarkdown %}`{% endverbatim %}
template tags.

- - -

#### Fenced code blocks

When using markdown fenced codeblocks may be used. Include code between ``` symbols that can
also take language hints:


```python
import sys
for line in open("data.txt"):
    print line.strip()[:10]
```
- - -

#### Include code

To include syntax highlighted code from a file write {% verbatim %}<code>{% code "context.py" lang="python" %}</code>{% endverbatim %}

{% code "context.py" lang="python" %}

This file is also special because of its name: `context.py`. The contents of
this python module is available inside every page under the name of `context`.

For example writing {% verbatim %}`{{ context.greeting }}`{% endverbatim %} produces: {{ context.greeting }}.

This is where the full power of `pyblue` shows. You see, you can go wild and add any and all
data that you might need. Call out to any program, read any file etc. It is all `Python` in there.

- - -

#### Include markdown

Alternatively one can instruct PyBlue to include the rendered content of markdown files.

To include `example.md` in original form one would use
{% verbatim %}<code>{% code "example.md" %}{% endverbatim %}</code> this would produce:

{%  code "example.md" %}

This same file could be included as html with {% verbatim %}<code>{% include_markdown "example.md" %}{% endverbatim %}</code>
In that case it will produce the following:

{% include_markdown "example.md" %}

- - -

#### Advanced templates

The [django templating][django_templates] system allows extending or including other templates or sections.

* {% verbatim %}<code>{% extend "sometemplate.html" %}</code>{% endverbatim %}
* {% verbatim %}<code>{% include "sometemplate.html" %}</code>{% endverbatim %}

These features support template inheritance and composition.

- - -

#### Overriding templates

By default all templates will be loaded from the root directory of your application
and if not found it will fall back to the `PyBlue` defaults.

Hence to override any
template just add that file with the same name. To override the `site_assets.html` that
contains the custom `css` and `js` modules create your own `site_assets.html` file in your project.

To help demonstrate how this works there is a simple example template tag called {% verbatim %}<code>{%  say_hello %}</code>{% endverbatim %}
Normally this tag will create the output: Hello World! because it is using a template that contains:

    Hello World!

This template tag accesses the template file called `say_hello.html`.
If it does not find it in the current directory it falls back to the default location that is part of `PyBlue`.

In the `templates` folder of your root directory create the file `say_hello.html` that contains

{%  code 'say_hello.html' %}

Now running {% verbatim %}<code>{%  say_hello %}</code>{% endverbatim %} will produce: {%  say_hello %}
- - -

#### Custom template tags

`PyBlue` comes with a few simple template tags such as `link` and `img` but it
also allows you to extend your templates with so called [custom template tags][templatetags].
There are some requirements nainly on naming.

For that to work your root directory must be an `import` ready python module.
This means a name that only has ascii characters and underscores and the root
directory must contain a file name `__ini__.py`. This file may be empty.

Once this is set up you may add your templatetags directory into the root folder as
desribed in the [custom template tags][templatetags] documentation.

[templatetags]: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/howto/custom-template-tags/

The `docs` root folder has its own `demotags` custom template tag

* {% verbatim %}<code>{%  boom 'PyBlue' %}</code>{% endverbatim %} will produce: {%  boom 'PyBlue' %}

- - -

#### Site assets

Add {% verbatim %}<code>{% site_assets %}</code>{% endverbatim %} to the head tag of the page to
generate the CSS classes needed to syntax color embedded code.

Override the template called `site_assets.html` to modify the assets.

#### Licensing

* PyBlue uses the [MIT license][license].
* PyBlue is being developed by Istvan Albert see https://github.com/ialbert
* PyBlue has been inspired by [PyGreen][pygreen] created by Nicolas Vanhoren see (https://github.com/nicolas-van/pygreen) but it does
  not use any code from it.
