SPARK
=====

SPARK stands for Scanning, Parsing, and Rewriting Kit. It uses Jay
Early's algorithm for LR parsing and comes with some generic Abstract
Syntax Tree routines. There is also a prototype scanner which does its
job by combining Python regular expressions.

The original version of this was written by John Aycock and was
described in his 1988 paper: "Compiling Little Languages in Python" at
the 7th International Python Conference.

Installation
------------

This uses `setup.py`, so it follows the standard Python routine:

::

    python setup.py install # may need sudo
    # or if you have pyenv:
   python setup.py develop

Example
-------

The github `example` directory_ has a worked out example; Package uncompyle6_
uses this and contains a much larger example.
