        This package exists because there are a number of common operations one would
        like to perform upon MongoDB databases, directly from a command line,
        without having to first write Javascript code to do so.  To ease the learning
        curve and resonate with the UNIX environment, many utilities in the mdbtools
        suite have been given names which reflect their similarity to UNIX tools of
        similar purpose.  The suite currently includes:  
        
        * mdbls      _list the contents of a database_
        * mdbtouch   _create a new, empty collection (and eventually, database)_
        * mdbrm      _remove a collection_
        * mdbcat     _display contents of a database/collection (not implemented yet)_
        * mdbquery   _perform one or more key=value queries on a collection_
        * mdbstats   _display summary statistics for one or more collections in a DB_
