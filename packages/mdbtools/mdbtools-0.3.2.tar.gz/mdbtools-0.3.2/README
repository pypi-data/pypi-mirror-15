# mdbtools
Python and UNIX CLI utilities to simplify common MongoDB DevOps tasks

This package exists because there are a number of common operations one would
like to perform upon MongoDB databases, directly from a command line,
without having to first write Javascript code to do so.  To ease the learning
curve and resonate with the UNIX environment, many utilities in the mdbtools
suite have been given names which reflect their similarity to UNIX tools of
similar purpose.  The suite currently includes:  

* **mdbls**      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_list the contents of a database_
* **mdbtouch**   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_create a new, empty collection (and eventually, database)_
* **mdbrm**      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_remove a collection_
* **mdbcat**     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_display contents of a database/collection (not implemented yet)_
* **mdbquery**   &nbsp;&nbsp;_perform one or more key=value queries on a collection_
* **mdbstats**   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_display summary statistics for one or more collections in a DB_
