Scrobble music playing on Chromecast devices to last.fm

Because I was annoyed that Spotify doesn't scrobble to last.fm when
using Chromecast. Currently will scrobble tracks playing on Spotify and
Google Play Music.

``pip install lastcast``

To setup a configuration for lastcast, either modify
``example.lastcast.toml`` as necessary and write it to
``~/.lastcast.toml``, or use the config creation tool:

``lastcast --wizard``

Once the configuration file is in place, run ``lastcast`` to connect to
the Chromecast and start scrobbling.
