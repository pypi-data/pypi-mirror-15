Release History
---------------

0.5.2 (2016-05-02)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* development migrated from BitBucket to GitHub

* ``redirect_stream``, ``redirect_stdout``, ``redirect_stderr`` and ``suppress``
  now explicitly inherit from ``object``, ensuring compatibility with
  ``ExitStack`` when run under Python 2.x (patch contributed by Devin
  Jeanpierre).

* ``MANIFEST.in`` is now included in the published sdist, ensuring the archive
  can be precisely recreated even without access to the original source repo
  (patch contributed by Guy Rozendorn)


0.5.1 (2016-01-13)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Python 2.6 compatilibity restored (although 2.6 is still missing from the
  current CI configuration) (patch contributed by Armin Ronacher)

* README converted back to reStructured Text formatting


0.5.0 (2016-01-12)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Updated to include all features from the Python 3.4 and 3.5 releases of
  contextlib (also includes some ``ExitStack`` enhancements made following
  the integration into the standard library for Python 3.3)

* The legacy ``ContextStack`` and ``ContextDecorator.refresh_cm`` APIs are
  no longer documented and emit ``DeprecationWarning`` when used

* Python 2.6, 3.2 and 3.3 have been dropped from compatibility testing

* tox is now supported for local version compatibility testing (patch by
  Marc Abramowitz)


0.4.0 (2012-05-05)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Issue #8: Replace ContextStack with ExitStack (old ContextStack API
  retained for backwards compatibility)

* Fall back to unittest2 if unittest is missing required functionality


0.3.1 (2012-01-17)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Issue #7: Add MANIFEST.in so PyPI package contains all relevant files
  (patch contributed by Doug Latornell)


0.3 (2012-01-04)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Issue #5: ContextStack.register no longer pointlessly returns the wrapped
  function
* Issue #2: Add examples and recipes section to docs
* Issue #3: ContextStack.register_exit() now accepts objects with __exit__
  attributes in addition to accepting exit callbacks directly
* Issue #1: Add ContextStack.preserve() to move all registered callbacks to
  a new ContextStack object
* Wrapped callbacks now expose __wrapped__ (for direct callbacks) or __self__
  (for context manager methods) attributes to aid in introspection
* Moved version number to a VERSION.txt file (read by both docs and setup.py)
* Added NEWS.rst (and incorporated into documentation)


0.2 (2011-12-15)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Renamed CleanupManager to ContextStack (hopefully before anyone started
  using the module for anything, since I didn't alias the old name at all)


0.1 (2011-12-13)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Initial release as a backport module
* Added CleanupManager (based on a `Python feature request`_)
* Added ContextDecorator.refresh_cm() (based on a `Python tracker issue`_)
