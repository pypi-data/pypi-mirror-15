Calculates and compares the radiance of a thermal LANSAT scene to the "ground truth"
radiance as measured by a NOAA buoy. Based on work by Frank Padula and Monica Cook.

If you want to use this code, you should have a basic knowledge of python and/or basic coding.

OVERVIEW:
    This code essentially has two funtions: calculating the radiance from the landsat image 
    provided, and calculating the corresponding ground truth radiance from outside data,
    atmospheric (NARR or MERRA-2), NOAA buoy data, and MODTRAN. Use the file controller.py as
    a convinient command line interface or the underying class itself, in bin/BuoyCalib.py.

    NARR: 
        This is the primary atmospheric data source for the project. Height, Temperature, 
        Humidity as a funtion of Pressure. NCEP Reanalysis data provided by the NOAA/OAR/ESRL
        PSD, Boulder, Colorado, USA, from their Web site at http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/

    MERRA-2:
        This is the secondary atmospheric data source for the project. Height, Temperature, 
        Humidity as a funtion of Pressure. It was instituted as a result of the NARR dataset 
        not being up to date. Until late 2016, the NARR archive only reaches to late 2014.

USAGE: 
    ./buoy-calib, in this directory. Use the -h option for more information 
    on flags and options that are available.

    ./buoy-calib [options] <Landsat_ID>

    Examples:
        ./buoy-calib -i LC80130332013145LGN00 : Output an image with the location 
                                                 of the buoy and narr points drawn on it
        ./buoy-calib -m LE70160382012268EDC00 : Use MERRA data instaed of NARR
        ./buoy-calib -b 44009 LT50410372011048PAC01 : use a specific NOAA buoy
        ./buoy-calib -imvr LC80130332013145LGN00 : Output an image, verbose, reprocesss, with MERRA data
        ./buoy-calib LE70160382012268EDC00 LC80130332013145LGN00 : process more than one scene


    The Landsat ID can be any valid ID from landsat 5 or 8 with a level 1 product available.
    If there is an error, check earth explorer first. It is frequently down for maitenance.
    In future, there may be a tool included with this package to check if the ID is valid before 
    trying to download. Stay tuned.

TOOLS:
    tools/to_csv.py: used to compile results quickly and easily.
    tools/generate_atmo_figure.py : generate a figure using information from a already processed scene.
    test/functional/run_all_scenes.bash: run a batch of scenes. Move it to this directory before use.
