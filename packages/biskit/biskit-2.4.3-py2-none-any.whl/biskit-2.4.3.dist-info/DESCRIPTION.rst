Biskit is a modular, object-oriented Python library for structural
bioinformatics research. It facilitates the manipulation and analysis
of macromolecular structures, protein complexes, and molecular
dynamics trajectories. For efficient number crunching, Biskit objects
tightly integrate with numpy. Biskit also offers a platform for the
rapid integration of external programs and new algorithms into complex
workflows. Calculations are thus often delegated to established
programs like Xplor, Amber, Hex, Prosa, T-Coffee, TMAlign, Reduce and
Modeller; interfaces to further software can be added easily.
