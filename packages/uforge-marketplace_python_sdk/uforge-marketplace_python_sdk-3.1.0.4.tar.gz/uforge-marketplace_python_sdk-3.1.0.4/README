Marketplace Python API
======================

The API is automatically generated with apitools/python/ApiAndCli_gen

To generate it, put the Marketplace application.wadl and the Marketplace XSD in apitools/python/ApiAndCli_gen/data
Then:
(cd apitools/python/ApiAndCli_gen/; python setup.py clean build)
This will generate a folder called application in apitools/python/ApiAndCli_gen/build.
Then you need to do : mv apitools/python/ApiAndCli_gen/build/application apitools/python/Marketplace_python_sdk/src/marketplace
