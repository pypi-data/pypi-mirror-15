Description: filks
        =====
        
        Generates silly poems based off of mad-libbed, serious poems, a tagged
        text corpus, and a pronunciation dictionary.
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        1. Python 3.3+
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        To install:
        
        ::
        
            pip install filks
            filk install
        
        The ``filk install`` step is not *strictly* necessary if you plan to use
        strictly a library and corpus you already have installed; however in
        most cases this will be most convenient. This step downloads the
        ``nltk`` library texts to your machine.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        To generate a terrible poem:
        
        ::
        
            filk format
        
        See ``filk format -h`` for options.
        
        Development
        ===========
        
        To build the dev environment:
        
        ::
        
            make venv
            . venv/bin/activate
            python main.py
        
        LICENSING
        =========
        
        All original source code in this repo, including all \*.py and
        configuration files, is released under the MIT license included.
        
        However, this library relies on corpuses from ``nltk`` which may have a
        variety of free-ish licenses.
