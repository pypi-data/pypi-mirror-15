        ======
        
        What is it?
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ``ggplot`` is the Python version of the grammar of graphics. It is not
        intended to be a feature-for-feature port of
        ```ggplot2 for R`` <https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2>`__. There is much
        greatness in ``ggplot2``, the Python world could stand to benefit from
        it.
        
        You can do cool things like this:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            ggplot(diamonds, aes(x='price', color='clarity')) + \
                geom_density() + \
                scale_color_brewer(type='div', palette=7) + \
                facet_wrap('cut')
        
        .. figure:: ./docs/example.png
           :alt: 
        
        Installation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ pip install -U ggplot
            # or
            $ conda install ggplot
            # or
            pip install pip install git+https://github.com/yhat/ggplot.git
        
        Examples
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        -  `gallery <./docs/Gallery.ipynb>`__
        -  `various examples <./examples.md>`__
        
        What happened to the old version that didn't work?
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        It's gone--the windows, the doors,
        `everything <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuxCKv_0GZc>`__. I deleted
        most of the code and only kept what worked. The data grouping and
        manipulation bits were re-written (so they actually worked) with things
        like facets in mind.
        
        Where did ``stat_identity`` and ``geom_raster`` go?
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        They're gone. They didn't even come close to working (also what does
        ``stat_identity`` even do) so they're gone.
