# plumbery

Are you looking for a cloud plumber? We hope that this one will be useful to
you.

## What does plumbery do?

Plumbery is a command-line utility for both Windows and Linux that takes a "fittings file", which is a file describing your desired cloud infrastructure on the Dimension Data Cloud and builds it for you.
Plumbery is idempotent, so you can run it multiple times with the same outcome.

Plumbery also includes a library of example "post-deploy" scripts, supporting cloud-config, for Linux distributions.

A Fittings file is written in a basic YAML file, which can be either HTTP path, or a local file path

```yaml
locationId: EU6
regionId: dd-eu

blueprints:

  - myBluePrint:
      domain:
        name: myDC
      ethernet:
        name: myVLAN
        subnet: 10.1.10.0
      nodes:
        - myServer
```

This will provision:

* A Network Domain called "myDC"
* A VLAN inside that domain called "myVLAN" with the subnet 10.1.10.0/24
* A server called "myServer" with a primary NIC on "myVLAN"

Fittings files can be deployed in a single command

```bash
$ python -m plumbery fittings.yaml deploy
```

## Post-Deploy actions and cloud-config support

Having actions run on the server, immediately after deployment is a common use case. Today, without plumbery this poses a challenge. Plumbery supports cloud-init's cloud-config syntax so post-deploy comamnds like:

* Install packages
* Setup DevOps tools like Puppet, Chef, Salt agent
* Set SSH private keys
* Create users
* Map disk partitions
* Run arbitrary commands

```yaml
  nodes:

    - myServer:
       cloud-config:
         users:
           - name: demo
             groups: sudo
             shell: /bin/bash
             sudo: ['ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL']
             ssh-authorized-keys:
               - ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDf0q4PyG0doiBQYV7OlOxbRjle026hJPBWD+eKHWuVXIpAiQlSElEBqQn0pOqNJZ3IBCvSLnrdZTUph4czNC4885AArS9NkyM7lK27Oo8RV888jWc8hsx4CD2uNfkuHL+NI5xPB/QT3Um2Zi7GRkIwIgNPN5uqUtXvjgA+i1CS0Ku4ld8vndXvr504jV9BMQoZrXEST3YlriOb8Wf7hYqphVMpF3b+8df96Pxsj0+iZqayS9wFcL8ITPApHi0yVwS8TjxEtI3FDpCbf7Y/DmTGOv49+AWBkFhS2ZwwGTX65L61PDlTSAzL+rPFmHaQBHnsli8U9N6E4XHDEOjbSMRX user@example.com
         runcmd:
           - touch /test.txt
```
