PinchLib
=================
This API SDK was automatically generated by APIMATIC v2.0

This SDK uses the Requests library and will work for Python 2.6 â€” 3.5.

How To Configure:
=================
The generated code might need to be configured with your API credentials. To do that,
open the file "Configuration.py" and edit its contents.

How To Build: 
=============
The generated code uses Python libraries named Requests and Jsonpickle. 

PIP is a popular tool for managing python packages[1].
To resolve these packages:
1) From terminal/cmd navigate to the root directory
2) Invoke 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

Note: You will need internet access to resolve these dependencies.

How To Use:
===========
The following shows how to make invoke the WebhookTypeController controller.
It is also shown in [2].

    1. Create a "WebhookTypeControllerTest.py" file in the root directory.
    2. Add the following import statement 
        'from PinchLib.Controllers.WebhookTypeController import *'
    3. Create a new instance using 'controller = WebhookTypeController()'
    4. Invoke an endpoint with the appropriate parameters, for example
        'response = controller.list(<required parameters if any>)'
    5. "response" will now be an object of type Webhook Type.
    6. To test the response you get, print out a property of "response",
        For Python2: 'print response.id'.
        For Python3: 'print(response.id)'.

	controller = WebhookTypeController()
    response = controller.list()

    print (response.id)

    #or you can print more information
    print (response.resolve_names())
