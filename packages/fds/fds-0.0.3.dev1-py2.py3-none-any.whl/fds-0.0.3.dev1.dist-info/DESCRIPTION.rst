What's it for
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

fds is a research tool for computational simulations that exhibis
chaotic dynamics. It computes sensitivity derivatives of time averaged
quantities, a.k.a. statistics, with respect simulation parameters.

For an introduction of chaotic dynamics, I highly recommend `Strogatz's
excellent book <https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0813349109>`__. For a
statistical view of chaotic dynamical systems, please refer to
`Berlinger's
article <http://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/files/papers/others/1992/berliner1992a.pdf>`__
Algorithm used in this software is described in `the upcoming AIAA
paper <https://dl.dropbox.com/s/2e9jxjmwh375i01/fds.pdf>`__

Download and use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to download fds is using pip. Pip is likely included in
your Python installation. If not, see `instruction
here <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`__. To install fds
using pip, simply type

::

    sudo pip install fds
