The *typed-astunparse* is to *typed-ast* as *astunparse* is to *ast*. In short: unparsing of Python
3.5 abstract syntax trees (AST) with type comments.

The built-in *ast* module has capabilites to parse Python source code into AST. It does not,
however, have the capability to generate source code from the AST. That's where *astunparse* comes
in. Using a refactored version of an obscure script found in official Python repository, it provides
code generation capability for built-in AST.

Built-in *ast* module, however, completely ignores type comments introduced in PEP 484. It treats
them like all other comments, so when you parse the code using :python:`compile()`, your type
comments will be lost. The *typed-ast* module intoduces AST and parser that includes type comments
defined in PEP 484.

Unfortunately, *typed-ast* also doesn't provide any means to go from AST to source code. This is
where this module, *typed-astunparse*, comes in. It provides unparser for AST defined in
*typed-ast*.

------------
requirements
------------

This package is intendended for Python 3.5. It was tested on 64 bit Ubuntu, but it might work on
other systems too.

typed-astunparse depends on:

-  astunparse

-  typed-ast

------------
installation
------------

For simplest installation use :bash:`pip`:

.. code:: bash

    pip3.5 install typed-astunparse

You can also build your own version:

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/mbdevpl/typed-astunparse
    cd typed-astunparse
    python3.5 -m unittest discover # make sure the tests pass
    python3.5 setup.py bdist_wheel
    ls -1tr dist/*.whl | tail -n 1 | xargs pip3.5 install

-----
usage
-----

Example of roundtrip from code through AST to code:

.. code:: python

    import typed_ast
    import typed_astunparse

    code = 'my_string = None # type: str'
    roundtrip = typed_astunparse.unparse(typed_ast.parse(code))
    print(roundtrip)

for more examples see :bash:`examples.ipynb` notebook.
