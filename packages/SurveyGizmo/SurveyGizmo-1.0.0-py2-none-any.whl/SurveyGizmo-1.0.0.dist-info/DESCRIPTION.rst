SurveyGizmo
===========

A Python Wrapper for
`SurveyGizmo <http://developer.surveygizmo.com/rest-api-documentation/>`__'s
restful API service.

|Build Status| |codecov|

Installation
------------

::

    $ pip install SurveyGizmo

Usage
-----

Start by instantiating the SurveyGizmo object and providing some
configuration parameters. Options can also be set through the ``config``
property.

.. code:: python

    from surveygizmo import SurveyGizmo

    client = SurveyGizmo(api_version='v4')
    client.config.api_token = "E4F796932C2743FEBF150B421BE15EB9"
    client.config.api_token_secret = "A9fGMkJ5pJF1k"

Calls to the api are by object type then by function. For example,

.. code:: python

    client.api.survey.list()
    client.api.survey.get('39501')
    client.api.survey.copy('39501', '39501 Copy')
    client.api.surveyresponse.list('39501')

Authentication
--------------

Token based authentication is the only currently supported
authentication method. ``user:pass`` and ``user:md5`` were
`deprecated <https://community.surveygizmo.com/questions/question/final-notice-surveygizmo-api-authentication-changes/>`__
on May 31, 2016. Oauth support is not currently a goal, but pull
requests are welcome.

token
~~~~~

.. code:: python

    client.config.api_token = 'E4F796932C2743FEBF150B421BE15EB9'
    client.config.api_token_secret = 'A9fGMkJ5pJF1k'

Config paramaters
-----------------

-  **api\_version** - 'v3', 'v4', 'head'. Defaults to 'head'
-  **api\_token**
-  **api\_token\_secret**
-  **response\_type** - ``None``, ``'json'``, ``'pson'``, ``'xml'``,
   ``'debug'``. By default (using ``None``), the API returns a JSON
   response which is parsed by the client into a python dictionary.
   Specifying a ``response_type`` will return an unparsed body of the
   specified format.
-  **requests\_kwargs** - Additional arguments passed to
   ``requests.get``. Useful for setting timeouts and otherwise
   configuring the requests library.
-  **prepare\_url** - Force the client to return the url after being
   prepared instead of executing the api call. This is useful in cases
   where you need to call the api asynchronously. Defaults to 'False'
-  **handler52x** - Handler for CloudFlare's 52x errors. Expects a
   callable (e.g., ``surveygizmo.default_52xhandler``). Defaults to
   'None'.

Filters
-------

A ``filter`` method has been added as a convenience for ``list()``
calls.

.. code:: python

    client.api.filter('datesubmitted', '<=', '2013-07-01')
    client.api.surveyresponse.list('39501')

Filters are chainable.

.. code:: python

    client.api.filter('datesubmitted', '>=', '2012-07-01').filter('datesubmitted', '<', '2013-07-01').list('39501')

CloudFlare 52x Errors
---------------------

After SurveyGizmo's move to CloudFlare, it isn't uncommon to see
connectivity issues where the service is temporarily unreachable. These
errors exist on the 52x range of HTTP status codes. To automatically
handle 52x errors, set a callable for ``config.handler52x``. A basic
handler is provided under ``surveygizmo.default_52xhandler``, which
simply retries the request every second until a non-52x response is
returned.

1.0.0 Changelog
---------------

-  Replace all authentication methods with only token based
   authentication.
-  Rewrite API to use class inheritance instead of module function
   wrapping.
-  Remove ``preserve_filters`` option.
-  Rename ``add_filter`` to just ``filter``. Filters are chainable.

0.2.0 Changelog
---------------

0.2.0 is a forwards incompatible release, but only minorly so.

Forwards incompatible changes:

-  Renamed the 'change' operations to 'update'. This is consistent with
   SurveyGizmo's API naming.
-  Removed the 'keep' kwarg for preserving filters bettween api funcion
   calls. This is now configured with 'preserve\_filters'. Filters are
   now cleared manually with ``api.clear_filters()``
-  Removed the undocumented 'url\_fetch' kwarg, which prevented api
   executioned and instead returned the prepared url.

Backwards incompatible changes:

-  Modified 'api\_version' to no longer has any effect on the client.
   SurveyGizmo provides no way to meaningfully differentiate between API
   versions, so this checking was unneeded and created code duplication
-  Added 'prepare\_url' as a replacement for 'url\_fetch'. This forces
   the client to return the url after being prepared instead of
   executing the api call. This is useful in cases where you need to
   call the api asynchronously.
-  Added 'requests\_kwargs'. These are additional arguments passed to
   ``requests.get``. Useful for setting timeouts and otherwise
   configuring the requests library.
-  Added handling for CloudFlare 52x errors
