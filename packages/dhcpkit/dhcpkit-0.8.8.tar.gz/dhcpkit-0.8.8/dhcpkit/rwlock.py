class RWLock:
    """
    Synchronization object used in a solution of so-called second
    readers-writers problem. In this problem, many readers can simultaneously
    access a share, and a writer has an exclusive access to this share.

    Additionally, the following constraints should be met:

    1) no reader should be kept waiting if the share is currently opened for
       reading unless a writer is also waiting for the share,
    2) no writer should be kept waiting for the share longer than absolutely
       necessary.

    The implementation is based on [1]_
    with a modification -- adding an additional lock (:attr:`__readers_queue`)
    -- in accordance with [2]_.
