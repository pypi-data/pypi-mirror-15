Description: # adsquery
        
        This tool let you query the ADS using a simple CLI.
        
        ## Installation
        You'll need an API key from NASA ADS labs. Sign up for the newest version of ADS search at https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu, visit account settings and generate a new API token. The official documentation is available at https://github.com/adsabs/adsabs-dev-api.
        
        You can then install the tool through pip:
        ```
        $ pip install adsquery
        ```
        
        After that, you should be able to use it under the name `adsquery`:
        ```
        $ adsquery --help
        $ adsquery query --help
        ```
        
        ## Querying
        To make a query to the ADS, try:
        ```
        $ adsquery query [my-query]
        ```
        The query can either be an ADS compatible query or a bashist one. For example:
        ```
        $ adsquery query --first-author Einstein 1915
        $ adsquery query ^Einstein 1915
        ```
        will result in the same results (papers by Einstein in 1915).
