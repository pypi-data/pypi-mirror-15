#kissanime-dl

Downloads all mp4s from a kissanime mastersite!
(kissanime.to/Anime/*)

##Currently supports as hosts:

Blogspot

Openload.co


##DOES NOT SUPPORT ONEDRIVE


#Dependencies:
lxml

requests

js2py

#Installation
##*nix or OSX:

```
STATIC_DEPS=true pip install lxml==3.5.0
pip install kissanime_dl
```

##Windows:

Windows is a tricky one.

Try:
```
pip install kissanime_dl
```

If you get an error like:
```
error: Microsoft Visual C++ 10.0 is required (Unable to find vcvarsall.bat)
```

There are more steps needed. First, go to

http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxml

and download the proper 3.5.0 lxml wheel.

Then, type
```
pip install PATH_LXML
```
where PATH_LXML is the path to the lxml wheel you downloaded.

Then, try to reinstall.

**FOR ALL WINDOWS INSTALLATIONS**

**BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE**

Due to a bug in pip, the script it generates is broken, and needs to be manually fixed.

Type in 
```
pip show kissanime-dl
```

and go up the filesystem to the pythonXX\Scripts directory, where there should be a file named
```
kissanime-dl-script.py
```
open it in a text editor and change
```
#!LONG, LONG, PATH
```
to 
```
#!"LONG, LONG, PATH"
```
This is because spaces in the path name screw everything up, and that bug in pip still hasn't been fixed.

Everything should be installed properly, and this can be verified by typing into cmd:
```
kissanime-dl
```

```

Type into shell:
kissanime-dl URL PATH_TO_DOWNLOAD OPT_ARGS

	If only OPT_END is given WITH "%", then all files before OPT_END will be downloaded.
	If OPT_BEG and OPT_END is given, then a range between the two will be downloaded.
