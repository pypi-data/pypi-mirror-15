Description: Kudzu - set of utilities for better logging in WSGI applications
        ==================================================================
        
        Kudzu provides WSGI middleware and logging handlers which:
        
         - Read or generate unique ID for each request and include this
           request ID in emitted log records.
         - Sends request ID in response using X-Request-ID header.
           This ID is also  made globally available and can included when
           calling other applications or components.
         - Logs all requests and responses using Python standard logging.
        
        
        Kudzu is framework independent and it is compatible with both
        Python 2 (tested with 2.6 and 2.7) and Python 3 (tested with 3.3 and 3.4).
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Kudzu can be installed using pip_ (or easy_install) from PyPI: ::
        
            $ pip install kudzu
        
        Alternatively you can download and extract tarball and install the package manually: ::
        
            $ python setup.py install
        
        Placing the package to your PYTHONPATH should also work.
        
        
        Example usage
        -------------
        
        ::
        
            # Apply middleware to WSGI application
            application = kudzify_app(application)
        
            # Include request ID and remote address in log records
            kudzify_logger(format='[%(addr)s|%(rid)s] %(levelname)s:%(message)s')
        
        
        See `example.py` for more information.
        
        
        Testing
        -------
        
        Tests for all supported Python versions can be run using Tox_: ::
        
            $ tox
        
        Alternativelly you can install Kudzu with test dependencies pytest
        and `Werkzeug` and run tests manually: ::
        
            $ py.test
