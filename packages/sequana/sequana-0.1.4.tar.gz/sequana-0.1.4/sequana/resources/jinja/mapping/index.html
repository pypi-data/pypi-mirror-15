This page informs you of the mapping depth coverage. Some regions are detected
with an unusual depth coverage and are showed below.
<div class="section" id="Coverage">
    <h2> 1 -  <a class="toc-backref" href="#id1">Coverage</a></h2>
    <div>
    The graphics shows the coverage as function of the position in the genome.
    </div>

<div class="section" id="Submapping list"> 
Mapping is split as multiple report for interactive graphics.
    {{ list_submapping }}

<div class="section" id="Z-Score distribution">
    <h2> 2 - <a class="toc-backref" href="#id1">Z-Score distribution</a></h2>
If everything is alright, we may see a Gaussian distribution center on 0. The
predicted Gaussian has as parameter mu={{ mu }} and sigma={{ sigma }}.

<div class="section" id="Low coverage region">
    <h2> 3 - <a class="toc-backref" href="#id1">Low coverage region</a></h2>
Region with a zscore lower than {{ low_cov_threshold_2 }} and at least one base
with a zscore lower than {{ low_cov_threshold }} are detected as low 
coverage region. Thus, there are {{ nb_low_region }} low coverage regions.
    {{ low_coverage }}
</div>

<div class="section" id="High coverage region">
    <h2> 4 - <a class="toc-backref" href="#id1">High coverage region</a></h2>
Region with a zscore higher than {{ high_cov_threshold_2 }} and at least on base
 with a zscore higher than {{ high_cov_threshold }} are detected as high 
coverage region. Thus, there are {{ nb_high_region }} high coverage regions.
    {{ high_coverage }}
