        Documentation
        =============
        
        The documentation for this project can be found at `http://pyspace.readthedocs.org/ <http://pyspace.readthedocs.org/>`_.
        
        Features
        ========
        
        -  A python interface for high performance C++ implementation of N-body
           simulation algorithms.
        -  PySpace has a numpy friendly API which makes it easier to use.
        -  Parallel support using OpenMP.
        -  GPU support using CUDA
        -  Dumps vtk output which allows users to take advantage of tools like
           ParaView, MayaVi, etc. for visualization.
        
        Algorithms
        ==========
        
        -  Brute Force :math:`O(n^2)`
        -  Barnes-Hut :math:`O(nlogn)`
         
        Installation
        ============
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        -  Numpy
        -  PyEVTK (``pip install pyevtk``)
        -  gcc compiler
        -  OpenMP (optional)
        -  ParaView / MayaVi or any other vtk rendering tool (optional)
        
        Linux and OSX
        -------------
        
        To install the latest stable version, run::
            
            $ pip install pyspace
        
        To install development version, clone this repository by:: 
        
            $ git clone https://github.com/adityapb/pyspace.git
        
        To install, run::
        
            $ python setup.py install
        
        To install without OpenMP, set ``USE_OPENMP`` environment variable
        to 0 and then install::
        
            $ export USE_OPENMP=0 
            $ python setup.py install
        
        To install without GPU support, set ``USE_CUDA`` environment variable
        to 0 and then install::
        
            $ export USE_CUDA=0
            $ python setup.py install
            
        Troubleshooting
        ---------------
        
        If you run into any issues regarding installation or otherwise, please report
        `here <https://github.com/adityapb/pyspace/issues>`_.
        
        Some common issues are addressed below
        
        CUDA not found
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Make sure if the CUDA toolkit is installed. If you still get this message after installation,
        follow the instructions given below.
        
        Add CUDA it to ``PATH`` environmental variable and try again
        
        Or, set ``CUDAHOME`` environmental variable to path of the CUDA installation by::
        
            $ export CUDAHOME=/usr/local/cuda
        
        Image not found
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If your code compiles and you get this error at runtime, make sure you have a CUDA
        compatible device installed.
        
        If you don't, install without GPU support (see Installation)
            
        **PySpace doesn't support Windows currently**
        
        Running the tests
        =================
        
        For running the tests you will need to install ``nose``, install using::
        
            $ pip install nose
        
        To run the tests, from project's root directory run::
            
            $ make test
        
        Running the benchmarks
        ======================
        
        For running benchmarks you will need to install ``pandas``, install using::
        
            $ pip install pandas
        
        To run the benchmarks, cd to benchmarks directory and run::
        
            $ python run_benchmarks.py
