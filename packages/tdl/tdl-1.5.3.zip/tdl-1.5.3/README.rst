==============
 Installation
==============
The latest Windows installers can be found on PyPI, you'll need to install the
latest version of these two packages:

* libtcod-cffi: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/libtcod-cffi
* python-tdl: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tdl

You might get errors during the installation of libtcod-cffi such as
"ImportError: No module named 'cffi.setuptools_ext'"
This will happen if your cffi module is out of date.

The recommended way to install is by using pip, but be sure to update your cffi
module first.  Use the following commands:

    pip install -U cffi
    pip install tdl

You could install manually, but you'd also have to install libtcod-cffi as well
which is a binary module.  This requires your Python installation to be set up
with a compiler.
