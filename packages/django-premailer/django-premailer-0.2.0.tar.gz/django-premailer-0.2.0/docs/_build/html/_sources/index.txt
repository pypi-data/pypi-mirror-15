History
-------

This package started out as a simple way to construct browser tests using YAML,
written by Brenton Cleeland.

The focus of this fork is to allow the developer to write programmatic unit
tests in the style of `unittest`_.

Currently this fork does not contain any of the CSS selector style methods that
were originally available as the focus has been on xpath only support until a
more robust CSS selector toolkit can be provided.
