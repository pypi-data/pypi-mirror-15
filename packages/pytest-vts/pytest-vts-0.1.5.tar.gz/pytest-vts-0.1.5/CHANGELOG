# v0.1.5

  - disable the matching of requests' bodies to the recorded requests
    bodies.

# v0.1.1 - v.0.1.3 #

  - minor changes to description page on PyPI

# v0.1.0 #

  - *recording* mode: when a cassette file is missing all http calls are
    requested using [requests][] library and the HTTP request-response
    pair is saved to the cassette file
  - *playback* mode: when a cassette file is present, its information
    is being rewind-ed into [responses][] callback mocks.
  - an unrecognized HTTP request during *playback* will obey the
    default behaviour of [responses][]
  - cassettes names and locations are determined by default using test
    module location and name.
  - `vts` pytest fixture is now parametrizable, using `indirect=[]`
