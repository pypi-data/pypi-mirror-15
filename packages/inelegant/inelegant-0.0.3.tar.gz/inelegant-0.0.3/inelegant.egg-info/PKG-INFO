Description: 
            "Inelegant" is a set of not very elegant tools to help testing. So far
            there are four packages:
        
            inelegant.net: the most important tools are the waiter functions.
            inelegant.net.wait_server_down() will block until a port in a host is not
            accepting connections anymore, and inelegant.net.wait_server_up() will
            block until a port in the host will be ready for receiving data. There is
            also inelegant.net.Server, that sets up a very dumb SocketServer.TCPServer
            subclass for testing.
        
            inelegant.finder: contains the inelegant.finder.TestFinder class. It is a
            unittest.TestSuite subclass that makes the task of finding test cases and
            doctests way less annoying.
        
            inelegant.module: with inelegant.module.create_module(), one can create
            fully importable Python modules. inelegant.module.installed_module() will
            create and remove the importable module.
        
            inelegant.process: home of inelegant.process.Process, a nice
            multiprocessing.Process subclass that makes the process of starting,
            stopping and communicating with a function in another process easier
            enough.
