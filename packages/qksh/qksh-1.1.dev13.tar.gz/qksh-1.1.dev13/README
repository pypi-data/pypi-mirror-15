f5 qksh
================

Introduction
------------
This project implements an SDK for the iControl REST interface for BIG-IP®.
Users of this library can create, edit, update, and delete configuration objects
on a BIG-IP®.

This project implements an utility for interacting with F5 iHealth. Users of
 this utility can upload qkview, download log file, config file and command
 output from an iHealth link.

Test
----
Before you open a pull request, your code must have passing
`pytest <http://pytest.org>`__ unit tests. In addition, you should
include a set of functional tests written to use a real BIG-IP device
for testing. Information on how to run our set of tests is included
below.

Unit Tests
~~~~~~~~~~
We use pytest for our unit tests.

#. If you haven't already, install the required test packages listed in
   requirements.test.txt in your virtual environment.

   .. code:: shell

       $ pip install -r requirements.test.txt

#. Run the tests and produce a coverage report. The ``--cov-report=html`` will
   create a ``htmlcov/`` directory that you can view in your browser to see the
   missing lines of code.

   .. code:: shell

       py.test --cov ./qksh --cov-report=html
       open htmlcov/index.html


Style Checks
~~~~~~~~~~~~
We use the hacking module for our style checks (installed as part of step 1 in
the Unit Test section).

.. code:: shell

    $ flake8 ./
