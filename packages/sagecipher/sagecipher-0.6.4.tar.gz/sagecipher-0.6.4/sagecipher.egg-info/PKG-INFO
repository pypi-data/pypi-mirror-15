        **sagecipher** (**s**\ sh **age**\ nt **crypt**) is a very small module
        which provides a cipher keyed through ``ssh-agent``. The key is obtained
        by generating random challenge data, passing this to ``ssh-agent`` to
        obtain a signature via the users private ssh-key for use as key
        material, and finally passing this through PBKDF2.

        Installation

        ::
        
            pip install sagecipher
        
        Usage 
        ------
        
        Before using, ``ssh-agent`` must be running with at least one ssh-key
        available for producing cipher key material:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            $ source <(ssh-agent)
            Agent pid 3710
        
            $ ssh-add
            Enter passphrase for /home/somebody/.ssh/id_rsa:
            Identity added: /home/somebody/.ssh/id_rsa (/home/somebody/.ssh/id_rsa)
        
        | If ``ssh-agent`` is not available or does not have any keys available,
          expect to see a
        | ``sagecipher.cipher.SignError`` Exception:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            >>> from sagecipher import *
            >>> cfail = Cipher()
            Traceback (most recent call last):
              File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
              File "sagecipher/cipher.py", line 101, in __init__
                signature = sign_via_agent(self.challenge, self.fingerprint)
              File "sagecipher/cipher.py", line 230, in sign_via_agent
                raise SignError(SignError.E_NO_KEYS)
            sagecipher.cipher.SignError: SSH agent is not running or no keys are available

        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Check ``sagecipher --help`` for usage...
        
        ::
        
            $ sagecipher encrypt - encfile
            secret sauce
            (CTRL-D)
            $ sagecipher decrypt encfile -
            secret sauce
            $ mkfifo decfile
            $ sagecipher decrypt encfile decfile &
            [1] 16753

        Using sagecipher in a Python program 
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        .. code:: python
        
            >>> from sagecipher import *
            >>>
            >>> # Create a new cipher using first key available from ssh-agent
            >>> c1 = Cipher()
            >>> 
            >>> # Use the cipher header to create a second/future instance
            >>> c2 = Cipher(c1.header())
            >>>    
            >>> # Display fingerprint of the SSH key used for derivation of cipher key
            >>> to_hex(c2.fingerprint)
            '11:66:89:44:a3:ec:9b:1c:55:cd:f7:54:20:3b:09:c3'
            >>>
            >>> # Encrypt with the first instance, decrypt back with the second...
            >>> unpad(c2.decrypt_string(c1.encrypt(pad("Hello, cryptic world!"))))
            'Hello, cryptic world!'
            >>>
            >>> # Encrypt and decrypt using helper methods.  The cipher header is
            >>> # stored in the encrypted ciphertext.
            >>> ciphertext = encrypt_string("Alice, I think someone is listening!")
            >>> plaintext = decrypt_string(ciphertext)
            >>> plaintext
            'Alice, I think someone is listening!'
