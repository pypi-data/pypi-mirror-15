**sagecipher** (**s**\ sh **age**\ nt **crypt**) is a very small module
which provides a cipher keyed through ``ssh-agent``. The key is obtained
by generating random challenge data, passing this to ``ssh-agent`` to
obtain a signature via the users private ssh-key for use as key
material, and finally passing this through PBKDF2.

Installation
------------

::

    pip install sagecipher

Usage
-----

Before using, ``ssh-agent`` must be running with at least one ssh-key
available for producing cipher key material:

.. code:: python

    >>> from sagecipher import *
    >>> cfail = Cipher()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
      File "sagecipher/cipher.py", line 101, in __init__
        signature = sign_via_agent(self.challenge, self.fingerprint)
      File "sagecipher/cipher.py", line 230, in sign_via_agent
        raise SignError(SignError.E_NO_KEYS)
    sagecipher.SignError: SSH agent is not running or no keys are available

With the ``ssh-agent`` environment set up and an ssh-key available, the
following usage example should work:

.. code:: sh

    $ source <(ssh-agent)
    Agent pid 3710

    $ ssh-add
    Enter passphrase for /home/psherratt/.ssh/id_rsa:
    Identity added: /home/psherratt/.ssh/id_rsa (/home/psherratt/.ssh/id_rsa)

.. code:: python

    >>> from sagecipher import *
    >>>
    >>> # Create a new cipher using first key available from ssh-agent
    >>> c1 = Cipher()
    >>> 
    >>> # Use the cipher header to create a second/future instance
    >>> c2 = Cipher(c1.header())
    >>>    
    >>> # Display fingerprint of the SSH key used for derivation of cipher key
    >>> to_hex(c2.fingerprint)
    '11:66:89:44:a3:ec:9b:1c:55:cd:f7:54:20:3b:09:c3'
    >>>
    >>> # Encrypt with the first instance, decrypt back with the second...
    >>> unpad(c2.decrypt_string(c1.encrypt(pad("Hello, cryptic world!"))))
    'Hello, cryptic world!'
    >>>
    >>> # Encrypt and decrypt using helper methods.  The cipher header is
    >>> # stored in the encrypted ciphertext.
    >>> ciphertext = encrypt_string("Alice, I think someone is listening!")
    >>> plaintext = decrypt_string(ciphertext)
    >>> plaintext
    'Alice, I think someone is listening!'
