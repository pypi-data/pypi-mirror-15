Description: # Redmon
        Monitor a Redis key
        
        ## Installation
        Redmon requires a working Redis connection.
        
        To install Redmon from pip,
        ```
          pip install redmon
        ```
        
        Or from source,
        ```
          python setup.py install
        ```
        
        ## Setup
        Redmon connects to your Redis connection with the following environment variables.
        If none are set, default values are used.
        - REDMON_REDIS_HOST (default, `localhost`) : Set it to where your Redis is running from.
        - REDMON_REDIS_PORT (default, `6379`)      : Set it to where your Redis is running on.
        - REDMON_TIME_INT (default, `1.0`)           : Set refresh interval for your Redis key
        
        ## Get Started
        To watch a Redis key, just simply
        
        ```
          redmon monitor --key=sample
        ```
        
        Redmon now watches a key called `sample` every second.
        
        ### Setting Refresh Intervals
        
        Changing the refresh interval for your monitor is very simple. You can either set it with
        an environment variable or by passing it as an argument.
        
        ```
        REDMON_TIME_INT=2 redmon monitor --key=sample
        ```
        
        ```
        redmon monitor --key=sample --interval=2
        ```
        
        Redmon now watches a key called `sample` every two seconds.
        
        **Intervals passed as arguments take precedence.**
        
        ```
        REDMON_TIME_INT=2 redmon monitor --key=sample --interval=3
        ```
        
        Redmon now watches a key called `sample` every three seconds.
        
        ## Running Tests
        Redmon uses `pytest` to write/run test cases. To run the test cases,
        
        ```
          cd tests
          py.test
        ```
