    "# Germ Selection\n",
    "The purpose of this tutorial is to illustrate \"germ selection\".  Germ selection is the process by which a complete set of germ gate sequences is constructed.  The defining property which makes a set of gate sequences a \"complete germ set\" is the amplification of *all* possible gate errors.  More precisely, the repetition of a complete set of germs, sandwiched between preparation and measurement fiducial sequences, will yield a sensitivity to *all* gate errors that scales with the number of times each germ is repeated.  This completeness is relative to the set of gates under consideration, typically a set of desired or \"target\" gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we find a complete germ set for the standard $X(\\pi/2)$, $Y(\\pi/2)$, $I$ gate set."

    "The perfect target gates may contain symmetries that result in certain parameters being amplified by the same germ sequence *coincidentally*.  We want to find a set of germs that amplifies slight deviations from the ideal gates as well, and so we find germs for a \"noisy\" version of the target gates, in which each ideal gate is composed with a random small unitary map."

    "The germ selection algorithm works by throwing unnecessary germs away from an initial (large) list that is assumed to be complete.  In this example, our initial list includes all gatestrings up to length three that are distinct up to powers and cycles.  Since germ sequences are repeated and sandwiched between fiducial sequences, a germ that is a power of another germ (i.e. the other germ repeated some number of times) or that is a cyclic permutation of another germ is effectively the same as the other germ.  The `list_all_gatestrings_without_powers_and_cycles` function provides a convenient way to list sequences gate sequences that are distinct up to such powers and cycles. "
