    "# 2-qubit GST with a custom 2-qubit gate\n",
    "While pyGSTi is able to support several common types of 2-qubit gates, the space of all possible 2-qubit gates is so large that some users will need to construct their own particular 2-qubit gate \"from scratch\".  In this tutorial, we look at how to construct a 2-qubit gateset with a \"non-standard\" 2-qubit gate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous tutorial gave an overview of the steps to run GST on a \"standard\" 2-qubit system.  In that case, the gate set, fiducials, germs, etc., are already contained in pyGSTi within a `pygsti.construction.stdXXX` module. The previous tutorial also showed how to use `build_gateset` to construct a gate set single-qubit rotations and a CNOT gate.  The only difference when working with a \"non-standard\" gate set is in the creation of the \"target gate set\" object.  Thus, **in this tutorial we focus only on creating a custom 2-qubit gate** - the rest of the procedure for doing 2-qubit GST is identical to that in the previous tutorial."

    "## Create a gateset with only single-qubit gates\n",
    "Since the space of single-qubit gates is relatively small, let's assume that the single-qubit gates in our gateset are able to be specified using the `build_gateset`.  Then we can construct a `GateSet` object containing all but the two-qubit gate(s) using `build_gateset` just as in other tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "If our 2-qubit gate happened to be one that *could* be specified using `build_gateset` then we would just use it to construct the entire `GateSet` and we would be done.  Currently, `build_gateset` can create any controlled $X$, $Y$, or $Z$ rotation using `CX`, `CY` and `CZ` (for details, see how `CX` was used to construct a CNOT gate in the previous tutorial)."
