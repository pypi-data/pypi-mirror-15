IntDump
=======


Interpret binary files in some predefined manners that help.

For the time being, we only interpret integers from binary files.


TODO
----

- Refer to the `conversion functionality`_ of IntelliCoder_ and
  figure out whether we integrate IntDump into it or not,
  or vice versa.

- Generalize to bindump instead of merely intdump.

  Say, adding some more useful predefined manners
  (a.k.a interpreters).
