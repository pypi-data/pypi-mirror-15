    """Performs I2C I/O transactions on an I2C bus.

    Transactions are performed by passing one or more I2C I/O messages
    to the transaction method of the I2CMaster.  I2C I/O messages are
    created with the reading, reading_into, writing and writing_bytes
    functions.

    An I2CMaster acts as a context manager, allowing it to be used in a
    with statement.  The I2CMaster's file descriptor is closed at
    the end of the with statement and the instance cannot be used for
    further I/O.

    For example:

        with I2CMaster() as i2c:
            i2c.transaction(
                writing(0x20, bytes([0x01, 0xFF])))
