Offline Translation
===================

You can export files for offline translation.  Once translated you can import
them again and Pootle will manage updating the translation in Pootle based on
your changes.

This feature is ideal for teams who have poor connectivity or if you prefer to
use an offline translation tool.

To export, simply click on the "Download for offline translation" link on the
sidebar in Pootle's overview page.  To import simply click the "Upload
translations" link and select the file you wish to upload.

.. warning:: If there are any errors in the upload then Pootle will warn you
   and the file will be rejected.

   The most likely reason would be someone translating online while you are
   working offline.  So be sure to communicate with your team if you will be
   working offline.
