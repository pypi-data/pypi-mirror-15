===========
The goal of the project is to provide a way to enable installation of carbon black sensors in a distrubuted manner as well as provide certain extended functionality such as registering users associated with sensors and tracking the sensor ID of systems installed.

-Tracking Sensor ID:
  In order to track sensor ID of systems Python is being utilized to perform a 
  call to the carbon black web api & return the sensor ID from a list of all  sensors where the computer name of the sensor matches the computer name of the  system being installed currently.
