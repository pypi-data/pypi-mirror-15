description="""Proof of concept packaged installer for carbon black with extended functionality',
long_description='The goal of the project is to provide a way to enable installation of carbon black sensors in a distrubuted manner as well as provide certain extended functionality such as registering users associated with sensors and tracking the sensor ID of systems that are currently being installed.

-Tracking Sensor IDs:
  In order to track the sensor ID of systems Python is being utilized to perform a 
  call to the Carbon Black (CB) Web API & return the sensor ID from the a list of all sensors on the CB server where the computer name of the sensor matches the computer name of the  system being installed.""",
