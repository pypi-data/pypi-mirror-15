bok-choy
========

UI-level acceptance test framework.  `Full documentation available on ReadTheDocs`__.

__ http://bok-choy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/


Overview
--------

A Python framework for writing robust Selenium tests.


Installation
------------

As Bok Choy is a Python framework, you first need to install Python.
If youâ€™re running Linux or Mac OS X, you probably already have it installed.
We recommend that you use `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_ to install your Python
packages:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install bok_choy


Running Tests
-------------

To run the test suite for bok-choy itself:

* Install Firefox, `version 46.0.1 <https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/46.0.1/>`_
  or earlier (later versions require a different selenium driver)
* Install `phantomjs <http://phantomjs.org/download.html>`_
* Create a virtualenv which uses Python 2.7
* With that virtualenv activated, run ``pip -r requirements/tox.txt`` to
  install the `tox <http://tox.testrun.org/>`_ testing tool and its
  dependencies
* Run ``tox -e py27``
* To test and build the documentation, run ``tox -e doc``
