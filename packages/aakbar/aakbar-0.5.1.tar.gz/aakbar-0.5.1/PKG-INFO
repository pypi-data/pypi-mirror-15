Description: aakbar
        ======
        Amino-Acid k-mer tools for creating, searching, and analyzing phylogenetic signatures from genomes and from short reads of DNA.
        
        Prerequisites
        -------------
        A 64-bit Python 3.4 or greater is required.  8 GB or more of memory is recommended.
        
        The python dependencies of aakbar are: biopython, click>=5.0, click_plugins numpy, pandas, pyfaidx,
        and pyyaml.  Running the examples also requires pyfastaq
        
        If you don't have a python installed that meets these requirements, I recommend getting
        `Anaconda Python <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>` on MacOSX and Windows for the smoothness
        of installation and for the packages that come pre-installed.  Once Anaconda python is installed,
        you can get the dependencies like this on MacOSX::
        
        	export PATH=~/anaconda/bin:${PATH}    # you might want to put this in your .profile
        	conda install --channel https://conda.anaconda.org/IOOS click-plugins
                conda install --channel https://conda.anaconda.org/bioconda pyfastaq
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        This package is tested under Linux and MacOS using Python 3.5 and is available from the PyPI: ::
        
             pip install aakbar
        
        If you wish to develop aakbar,  download a `release <https://github.com/ncgr/aakbar/releases>`_
        and in the top-level directory: ::
        
        	pip install --editable .
        
        If you wish to have pip install directly from git, use this command: ::
        
        	pip install git+https://github.com/ncgr/aakbar.git#egg=proj
        
         
        
        
        Basic Use
        ---------
        aakbar is implemented as a command-line program with subcommands.  To list these subcommands: ::
        
            aakbar --help
