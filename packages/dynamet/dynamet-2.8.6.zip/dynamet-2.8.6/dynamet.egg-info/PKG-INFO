Description: 
        DynaMet is a fully automated workflow for liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) raw
         data analyses allowing for metabolome-wide investigations of dynamic isotope labeling experiments. 
         DynaMet enables untargeted extraction of labeling profiles by grouping metabolite features 
         in different samples with isotopic patterns changing over time. 
         Integrated tools for expressive data visualization enhance result inspection. 
         REMARK: For straight forward installation of DynaMet type command `!pip install dynamet` in emzed
         IPython console and press enter. DynaMet app will be available after opening a new IPython 
         console.
         Changes in Version 2.8.0:
            - provides additional fitting function weibull.
            - allows opening results from dynamet projects with read rights only
            - improved feature grouping (low abundant peaks, UPLC data)
            - includes update to use latest hires package 0.0.14
            - requires emzed version 2.24.5 or higher
