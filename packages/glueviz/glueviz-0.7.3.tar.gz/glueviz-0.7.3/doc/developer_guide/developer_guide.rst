Developer Guide
===============

So you want to help develop Glue? Great, let's get started! :)

First, be sure to join the `glueviz-dev
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/glue-viz-dev>`_ mailing list for any
questions or discussions related to development, and let us know if any of the
documentation below is unclear. You are also very welcome to introduce yourself on the list and let us know that you are interested in contributing!

If you are going to be developing Glue, we highly recommend that you familiarize yourself with the rest of the documentation, and in particular the :ref:`architecture` documentation, which describes in detail how some of the Glue internals work.

If you want to contribute, but don't yet have a specific idea of where to make contributions, you can check out our `Issue tracker <https://github.com/glue-viz/glue/issues>`_. We use different labels to categorize the issues, and one label you might be interested in is `package-novice <https://github.com/glue-viz/glue/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3APackage-novice>`_, which highlights issues that don't require an in-depth understanding of the Glue package, but only require you to understand/edit a small part of the code base (which is typically mentioned in the issue).

The following pages provide more logistical information about the layout of the code, coding and testing guidelines, and some more advanced topics:
