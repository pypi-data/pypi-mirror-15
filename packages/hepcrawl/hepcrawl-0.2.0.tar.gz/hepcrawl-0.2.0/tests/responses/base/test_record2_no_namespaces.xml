ABSTRACT OF PART I: The behavior of an initially plane, strong shock wave propagating into a conical convergence is investigated experimentally and theoretically. In the experiment a [.] half-angle cone is mounted on the end of a pressure-driven shock tube. Shock waves with initial Mach numbers varying from 6.0 to 10.2 are generated in argon at a pressure of 1.5 torr. During each run local shock velocities at several positions along the cone axis are measured using a thin, multi-crystal piezoelectric probe inserted from the vertex. This technique produces accurate velocity data for both the incident and reflected shock waves. In the corresponding analysis, a simplified characteristics method is used to obtain an approximate solution of the axisymmetric diffraction equations derived by Whitham (1959). Both the shock velocity measurements and the axisymmetric diffraction solution confirm that the incident shock behavior is dominated by cyclic diffraction processes which originate at the entrance of the cone. Each diffraction cycle is characterized by Mach reflection on the cone wall followed by Mach reflection on the axis. These cycles evidently persist until the shock reaches the cone vertex, where the measured velocity has increased by as much as a factor of three. Real-gas effects, enhanced in the experiment by increasing the initial Mach number and decreasing the pressure, apparently alter the shock wave behavior only in the region near the vertex. Velocity measurements for the reflected shock within the cone show that the shock velocity is nearly constant throughout most of the convergence length. ABSTRACT OF PART II: The thermodynamic conditions behind the incident and reflected shock wave close to the vertex of a convergent channel are investigated spectroscopically. The investigation was initiated in order to better determine the possible uses of such a geometrical device as a tool for high temperature plasma research. Using argon at an initial pressure of 1.5 torr, the shock Mach number prior to the entrance of the cone is 10.2. Two windows are mounted at x/1 = 0.9 in the cone, where the Mach number has increased to 24, and the emitted radiation is monitored for both time-resolved (Monochromator - Photomultiplier) and time-integrated (Spectrograph) analysis. The relative line intensity method is used to measure the electron temperature. The Stark broadened profile of the 6965.4 [.] neutral argon line, and continuum intensity measurements are used to determine the electron number density. From initial values of [.] and [.], both the electron temperature and number density profiles behind the incident shock are dominated by the previous shock diffraction processes. The general trend is a gradual increase, presumably due to the continuing compression of the gas shocked at successively earlier times. Superimposed upon this is the effect of hot slugs of gas from previous localized regions of very high Mach number. The reflected shock wave heats and compresses the gas even further. The subsequent expansion results in a series of rapid exponential decreases in temperature, density and pressure. Immediately after the reflected shock wave has passed, the gas appears to be in a nonequilibrium state with a population inversion among the upper excited atomic energy levels. There is an indication of the presence of a second reflected wave. The effects of self-absorption on Stark broadened lines is studied. An equation is derived, demonstrating the effect of individual corrections that are necessary before accurate interpretations of measured quantities can be made. Simple self-absorption correction schemes are demonstrated and shown to be self-consistent.</description>

          <title>The effect of ground-state spin on fission and quasi-fission anisotropies</title>
          <title>are reproduced only when the nuclear spin and deformation?</title>
          <creator>Butt, Rachel Deborah</creator>
          <description>In heavy-ion induced fusion-fission reactions, the angular distribution of fission fragments is sensitive to the mean square angular momentum brought in by the fusion process, and the nuclear shape and temperature at the fission saddle point. Experimental fission fragment angular distributions are often used to infer one or more of these properties. Historically the analysis of these distributions has re­ lied on the alignment of the total angular momentum J of the compound nucleus, perpendicular to the projectile velocity. A full theoretical approach, written into a computer code for the first time, allows the effect of ground-state spin of the projectile and target nuclei to be correctly treated. This approach takes into account the change in alignment of J due to the inclusion of this spin, an effect which is shown to be markedly stronger if the nucleus with appreciable spin also has a strong quadrupole deformation. This change in alignment of J results in a much reduced fission fragment anisotropy. In extreme cases, the anisotropy may be below unity, and it ceases to be sufficient to characterise the fission fragment angular distribution. The calculations have been tested experimentally, by measuring fission and sur­ vival cross-sections and fission fragment angular distributions for the four reactions 31P+175,176Lu and 28.29 Si+178Hf, where 176Lu is a strongly-deformed nucleus with an intrinsic spin of 7 units, and 178Hf has very similar deformation, but zero spin. The reactions form the compound nuclei 206.207Rn. The total fusion excitation func­ tions are well-reproduced by calculations, but the fission fragment anisotropies are reproduced only when the nuclear spin and deformation are taken into account, con­ firming the theory and supporting the recent understanding of the role of nuclear deformation in the fusion process and of compound nucleus angular momentum in the fission process. Having established the effect in the well-understood fusion-fission reactions, the effect of nuclear spin is examined for the less well understood quasi-fission reaction. Experiments were performed to measure fission cross-sections and fission fragment angular distributions for the reactions 16O+235,238U, where 235U has a spin of 7/2 and 238U has a spin of zero. Both nuclei are quadrupole-deformed, and 160+238U was already known to exhibit evidence for quasi-fission. Theoretical calculations indicate that the fitted anisotropy is sensitive to the range of angles over which the angular distribution is measured, showing that where quasi-fission is present, the anisotropy is not sufficient to entirely characterise the fission fragment angular dis­ tribution. Comparison of the measured anisotropies with fusion-fission calculations shows clearly that the reaction is quasi-fission dominated. However, although exist­ ing quasi-fission models predict a strong effect from the spin of 235U, it is shown that the observed effect is appreciably stronger still in the experimental angular range. This should be an important tool in evaluating future models of the quasi-fission process.</description>
