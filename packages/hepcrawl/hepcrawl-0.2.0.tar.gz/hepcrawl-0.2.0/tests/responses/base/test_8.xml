          <dc:title>The effect of ground-state spin on fission and quasi-fission anisotropies</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Butt, Rachel Deborah</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>In heavy-ion induced fusion-fission reactions, the angular distribution of fission fragments is sensitive to the mean square angular momentum brought in by the fusion process, and the nuclear shape and temperature at the fission saddle point. Experimental fission fragment angular distributions are often used to infer one or more of these properties. Historically the analysis of these distributions has re­ lied on the alignment of the total angular momentum J of the compound nucleus, perpendicular to the projectile velocity. A full theoretical approach, written into a computer code for the first time, allows the effect of ground-state spin of the projectile and target nuclei to be correctly treated. This approach takes into account the change in alignment of J due to the inclusion of this spin, an effect which is shown to be markedly stronger if the nucleus with appreciable spin also has a strong quadrupole deformation. This change in alignment of J results in a much reduced fission fragment anisotropy. In extreme cases, the anisotropy may be below unity, and it ceases to be sufficient to characterise the fission fragment angular distribution. The calculations have been tested experimentally, by measuring fission and sur­ vival cross-sections and fission fragment angular distributions for the four reactions 31P+175,176Lu and 28.29 Si+178Hf, where 176Lu is a strongly-deformed nucleus with an intrinsic spin of 7 units, and 178Hf has very similar deformation, but zero spin. The reactions form the compound nuclei 206.207Rn. The total fusion excitation func­ tions are well-reproduced by calculations, but the fission fragment anisotropies are reproduced only when the nuclear spin and deformation are taken into account, con­ firming the theory and supporting the recent understanding of the role of nuclear deformation in the fusion process and of compound nucleus angular momentum in the fission process. Having established the effect in the well-understood fusion-fission reactions, the effect of nuclear spin is examined for the less well understood quasi-fission reaction. Experiments were performed to measure fission cross-sections and fission fragment angular distributions for the reactions 16O+235,238U, where 235U has a spin of 7/2 and 238U has a spin of zero. Both nuclei are quadrupole-deformed, and 160+238U was already known to exhibit evidence for quasi-fission. Theoretical calculations indicate that the fitted anisotropy is sensitive to the range of angles over which the angular distribution is measured, showing that where quasi-fission is present, the anisotropy is not sufficient to entirely characterise the fission fragment angular dis­ tribution. Comparison of the measured anisotropies with fusion-fission calculations shows clearly that the reaction is quasi-fission dominated. However, although exist­ ing quasi-fission models predict a strong effect from the spin of 235U, it is shown that the observed effect is appreciably stronger still in the experimental angular range. This should be an important tool in evaluating future models of the quasi-fission process.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Light manipulation by plasmonic nanostructures</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Liu, Wei</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>This thesis studies various effects based on the excitation of surfaces plasmons in various plasmonic nanostructures. We start the thesis with a general introduction of the field of plasmonics in Chapter 1. In this chapter we discuss both propagating surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) and localized surface plasmons (LSPs), how they are related to each other through the Bohr condition, the features of subwavelength confinement and near-field enhancement, and wave guidance through coupled LSPs. Then after the discussion of the achievements and challenges in this field (Section 1.3) we will outline the basic structure of the thesis at the end of this chapter (Section 1.4). In Chapter 2 we demonstrate a new mechanism to achieve complete spectral gap without periodicity along propagation direction based on the coupling of backward and forward modes supported by plasmonic nanostructures. We study the backward modes in single cylindrical plasmonic structures (Section 2.2) and focus on the two simplest cases: nanowires and nanocavities. Afterwards, we demonstrate how to achieve spectral gaps in coupled plasmonic nanocavities (Section 2.3). A polarization-dependent spectral gap is achieved firstly in two coupled nanocavities which support forward and backward modes respectively (Section 2.3.1). At the end we demonstrate a complete spectral gap, which is induced by the symmetry of a four-coupled-nanocavity system (Section 2.3.2). In Chapter 3 we study beam shaping in plasmonic potentials. Based on the similarity between Schrodinger equation for matter waves and paraxial wave equation for photons, we introduce the concept of plasmonic potentials and demonstrate how to obtain different kinds of potentials for SPPs in various modulated metal-dielectric-metal (MDM) structures. We investigate firstly the parabolic potentials in quadratically modulated MDM and the beam manipulations in such potentials, including polychromatic nanofocusing in full parabolic potentials (Section 3.2.1), plasmonic analogue of quantum paddle balls in half parabolic potentials (Section 3.2.2), and adiabatic nanofocusing in tapered parabolic potentials (Section 3.2.3). In the following section (Section 3.3) we show the existence of linear plasmonic potentials in wedged MDM and efficient steering of the Airy beams in such potentials (Section 3.3.2) after a brief introduction on Airy beams in free space (Section 3.3.1). In Chapter 4 we study scattering engineering by magneto-dielectric core-shell nanostructures. The introduction part (Section 4.1) gives a brief overview on the scattering of solely electric dipole (ED) or magnetic dipole (MD), and how the coexistence and interference of the ED and the MD can bring extra flexibility for scattering shaping. Afterwards, we discuss the scattering shaping by core-shell nanostructures through the interferences of electric and artificial magnetic dipoles (Section 4.2), including two examples of broadband unidirectional scattering by core-shell nanospheres (Section 4.2.1) and efficient scattering pattern shaping of core-shell nanowires (Section 4.2.2). At the end of this chapter we demonstrate polarization independent Fano resonances in arrays of core-shell nanospheres (Section 4.3.2). At the end of this thesis (Chapter 5) we summarize the results and draw the conclusions. We also discuss the challenges and possible future developments of the field of plasmonics.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Storage and manipulation of optical information using gradient echo memory in warm vapours and cold ensembles</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Sparkes, Benjamin Michael</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Quantum memories for light lie at the heart of long-distance provably-secure communication [1], while containing the potential to help break current encryption methods [2], and allow better measurement of quantities than ever before [3]. Demand for a functioning quantum memory is therefore at a premium. Unfortunately, the same properties of light that make it such an effective carrier of quantum information make it difficult to store. Furthermore, by the laws of quantum mechanics, storage must be achieved without measurement to preserve the quantum state. A quantum memory needs to have an efficiency approaching unity without adding noise to the state, and storage times from milliseconds to seconds. Ideally it would also have a high bandwidth and be able to store many pieces of information simultaneously. Many different techniques are currently being developed and much experimental progress has been made over the past few years, with: efficiencies approaching 90% [4]; storage times of over seconds [5]; bandwidths of gigahertz [6, 7]; and over 1000 pieces of information stored at one time [8]. These results were, however, achieved using different memory schemes in different storage media. The challenge now is to reproduce these results with one memory. This thesis focuses on extending the gradient echo memory (GEM) scheme, which shows great promise due to the high efficiencies achieved (87%) [4]. GEM has also been used to demonstrate temporal compression and stretching of pulses, as well as a capacity to arbitrarily resequence stored information [9] and the interference of initially time-separated pulses [10]. Firstly, we demonstrate the noiseless nature of GEM storage in a warm vapour cell to prove that the output from the memory is the best-possible copy of the input allowed by quantum mechanics. We show GEM’s ability to coherently and precisely spectrallymanipulate stored information by having fine control over the memory’s frequency gradient, with potential applications for dynamic conditioning of information inside quantum networks [11]. We demonstrate cross-phase modulation of a stored light pulse with an additional optical field, a process with applications in quantum computing [12]. We also carry out storage of different spatial modes and arbitrary images, demonstrating the potential for orders of magnitude improvement in storage capacity. We then switch from warm vapour cells to cold atomic ensembles to improve the storage time of GEM, seeing a maximum coherence time of 350 μs (seven times that of the warm vapour system) and achieving efficiencies of up to 80%, on a par with the highest efficiency achieved with a cold atomic ensemble [13]. In the process we developed an ultra-dense cold atomic cloud with potential applications in a range of quantum optics experiments. Cold atoms, and the small volumes they occupy, also allowed us to develop an alternative to using magnetic field gradients for our alkali-atom memories in the form of a light-field gradient. This holds promise for extremely fast gradient switching and fine control over the gradient. We also present a digital locking code with application in a range of quantum optics experiments.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Investigation of ion-track morphology and annealing behavior using small-angle X-ray scattering</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Afra, Boshra</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>When heavy ions with energies in the range of hundreds of MeV to GeV penetrate a solid, they lose their energy through inelastic interactions with the target electrons and can leave narrow cylindrical trails of permanent damage along their path, known as ion tracks. Ion tracks are typically a few nanometers in diameter and can be up to tens of micrometers long. When these tracks are annealed at elevated temperatures, they shrink in size and eventually the damage inside the material can recover. In this project ion tracks are studied in Durango apatite, San Carlos olive and synthetic quartz. In minerals such as apatite track formation can result from spontaneous fission of naturally occurring uranium inclusions that produces high energetic fragments. These so called “fission tracks” are used for dating and constraining the thermal history of geological samples. The current dating methods, however, utilize chemical etching, which destroys the primary damage such that essential information on the actual scale of the underlying radiation damage is irrevocably lost. A detailed understanding of the un-etched track damage in minerals and its dependence on geologically relevant conditions is of fundamental importance for the application of etched tracks in geo- and thermochronology. Tracks in olivine are used for identification of cosmic rays in meteorites. Many meteorites contain different amounts of olivine which is a crystalline mineral susceptible to ion track formation from high energetic cosmic particles. Studying the annealing behavior of ion tracks in meteorites can lead to estimation of the temperature of the mineral during track formation. In quartz, swift heavy ion irradiation leads to a change in the refractive index of the material inside the narrow tracks and provides new possibilities for fabrication and micromachining of optical devices. Annealing of ion tracks in quartz is of interest as for example device fabrication processes often involve elevated temperatures. In this work synchrotron based small angle x-ray scattering in combination with in situ and ex situ annealing experiments is used to study the morphology and damage recovery of un-etched ion tracks. It is demonstrated that SAXS is a powerful tool for studying ion track damage in a variety of materials as it is sensitive to small density changes at the nanometer scale that often occur in the damaged regions. It is a non-destructive technique and can be used to determine changes in the track radii with sub-nanometer precision. Short acquisition times make it well suited for studying track annealing kinetics in situ. The work presented in this thesis has aided in developing the possibilities that small angle x-ray scattering can provide for studying the morphology and annealing behavior of nano sized damage structures. The high accuracy with which the track radii can be determined using SAXS, the nondestructive, artifact-free measurement methodology, as well as the data analysis models introduced in this work provide an effective means for in-depth studies of ion-track morphology and annealing behavior in a variety of materials.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The impact of magnetic geometry on wave modes in cylindrical plasmas</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Chang, Lei</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>Both space and laboratory plasmas can be associated with static magnetic field, and the field geometry varies from uniform to non-uniform. This thesis investigates the impact of magnetic geometry on wave modes in cylindrical plasmas. The cylindrical configuration is chosen so as to explore this impact in a tractable but experimentally realisable configuration. Three magnetic geometries are considered: uniform, focused and rippled. For a uniform magnetic field, wave oscillations in a plasma cylinder with axial flow and azimuthal rotation are modelled through a two-fluid flowing plasma model. The model provides a qualitatively consistent description of the plasma configuration on a Radio Frequency (RF) generated linear magnetised plasma (WOMBAT, Waves On Magnetised Beams And Turbulence [Boswell and Porteous, Appl. Phys. Lett. 50, 1130 (1987)]), and yields agreement between measured and predicted dependences of the wave oscillation frequency with axial field strength. The radial profile of the density perturbation predicted by this model is consistent with the data. Parameter scans show that the dispersion curve is sensitive to the axial field strength and the electron temperature, and the dependence of the oscillation frequency with electron temperature matches the experiment. These results consolidate earlier claims that the density and floating potential oscillations are a resistive drift mode, driven! by the density gradient. This, to our knowledge, is the first detailed physics modelling of plasma flows in the diffusion region away from the RF source. For a focused magnetic field, wave propagations in a pinched plasma (MAGPIE, MAGnetised Plasma Interaction Experiment [Blackwell et al., Plasma Sources Sci. Technol. 21, 055033 (2012)]) are modelled through an ElectroMagnetic Solver (EMS) based on Maxwell's equations and a cold plasma dielectric tensor. [Chen et. al., Phys. Plasmas 13, 123507 (2006)] The solver produces axial and radial profiles of wave magnitude and phase that are consistent with measurements, for an enhancement factor of 9.5 to the electron-ion Coulomb collision frequency and a 12% reduction in the antenna radius. It is found that helicon waves have weaker attenuation away from the antenna in a focused field compared to a uniform field. This may be consistent with observations of increased ionisation efficiency and plasma production in a non-uniform field. The relationship between plasma density, static magnetic field strength and axial wavelength agrees well with a simple theory developed previously. More! over, the wave amplitude is lowered and the power deposited into the core plasma decreases as the enhancement factor to the electron-ion Coulomb collision frequency increases, possibly due to the stronger edge heating for higher collision frequencies. For a rippled magnetic field, the spectra of radially localised helicon (RLH) waves [Breizman and Arefiev, Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 3863 (2000)] and shear AlfvÃ©n waves (SAW) in a cold plasma cylinder are investigated. A gap-mode analysis of the RLH waves is first derived and then generalised to ion cyclotron range of frequencies for SAW. The EMS is employed to model the spectral gap and gap eigenmode. For both the RLH waves and SAW, it is demonstrated that the computed gap frequency and gap width agree well with the theoretical analysis, and a discrete eigenmode is formed inside the gap by introducing a defect to the system's periodicity. The axial wavelength of the gap eigenmode is close to twice the system's periodicity, which is consistent with Bragg's law, and the decay length agrees well with the analytical estimate. Experimental realisation of a gap eigenmode on a linear plasma device such as the LArge Plasma Device (LAPD) [Gekelman et al., Rev. Sci. Instrum. 62, 2875 (1991)] may be possible by introducing a symmetry-breaking defect to the system's periodicity. Such basic science studies could provide the possibility to accelerate the science of gap mode formation and mode drive in toroidal fusion plasmas, where gap modes are introduced by symmetry-breaking due to toroidicity, plasma ellipticity and higher order shaping effects. These studies suggest suppressing drift waves in a uniformly magnetised plasma by increasing the field strength, enhancing the efficiency of helicon wave production of plasma by using a focused magnetic field, and forming a gap eigenmode on a linear plasma device by introducing a local defect to the system's periodicity, which is useful for understanding the gap-mode formation and interaction with energetic particles in fusion plasmas.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Foundation experiments in quantum atom optics with ultracold metastable helium</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Manning, Andrew Geoffrey</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The field of atom optics has progressed rapidly over the past 20 years since the realisation of Bose-Einstein condensation, such that the wave behaviour of atomic gases is now routinely demonstrated. Furthermore, the study of quantum atom optics, which goes beyond a ‘mean-field’ description of quantum systems to consider the behaviour of single particles, has demonstrated both the similarities between photons and massive species, and their differences as a result of the internal structure and external interactions of atoms. An important class of observable quantities which allow such effects to be measured are nth order correlation functions, which can be interpreted as a result of either particle or wave behaviour. These functions provide a statistical description of fluctuations in n-tuples of particles in a source, which rigorously defines concepts such as coherence. The quantum statistics of a Bose-Einstein condensate should be the same as that for an optical laser, while an ideal thermal Bose gas matches the behaviour of incoherent light. However, correlation measurements can also be used to quantify the influence of interactions, dimensionality, confining potentials and waveguides, and the difference in quantum statistics between fermions and bosons, which illustrates the rich range of behaviour exhibited by atomic gases. In this thesis, several aspects of quantum atom optics are explored with experiments using ultracold metastable helium, a species with the unique advantage of facilitating simple single-atom detection with high resolution, while still allowing Bose-Einstein condensates to be formed. The coherence of atomic systems is shown to be maintained when outcoupled as pulsed atom lasers, and the long-range order characteristic of Bose-Einstein condensates is demonstrated to third order for the first time. Conversely, thermal bunching is observed for a variety of atomic systems, including the measurement of correlation functions up to sixth order with near-ideal interference contrast. These results clearly demonstrate the correspondence between the quantum statistics of photons and atoms as was formalised by Glauber, as well as confirming the validity of applying Wick’s theorem to simplify the statistics of atomic gases. Correlation functions are also shown to be an ideal tool to probe the quantum state of an ultracold gas, and were used to observe the phenomenon of transverse condensation in an elongated Bose gas, as well as characterise the mode occupancy of matter waves guided by an optical potential. Ultracold metastable helium is also suitable for exploring other fundamental topics in quantum optics such particle/wave duality. The notion of complementarity stimulated long running philosophical discussions about how apparently mutually exclusive behaviours can coexist, which culminated in Wheeler devising his famous ‘delayed choice’ gedankenexperiment. A proposed experimental method to realise Wheeler’s experiment with ultracold atoms is discussed, and preliminary measurements presented which indicate that the completion of this experiment could be achieved in the near future. Not only is this of interest in its own right, but the implementation of this experiment has also developed techniques which may enable further studies in quantum atom optics such as investigations of the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect and quantum entanglement with massive particles.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>The theory of unbound modes on circular dielectric waveguides</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Sammut, Rowland Alexander</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>The electromagnetic field propagating along an ideal dielectric waveguide may contain both bound and unbound (radiation) components. In a transverse spectral representation, the bound field is represented by a finite sum of discrete modes but the unbound field requires integration over a continuum of modes. This integration, while it provides an exact description of the radiation field, can be very slowly convergent. An asymptotic representation using improper (leaky) modes is more rapidly convergent but is only valid in a restricted region of space. The purpose of this thesis is to study both the spectral and improper unbound modes, and the connection between them. Chapter 1 provides some general background to the modal theory of electromagnetic-field propagation in dielectric waveguides, with particular emphasis on the unbound modes" It defines the physical system to be studied and the basic notation to be used in the remainder of the thesis and, along the way, re-derives some well-known results of electromagnetic theory for later use. In Chapter 2, the bound modes of a circular dielectric rod are listed, and the spectral radiation modes derived, in a form found most useful for later analysis. Orthogonality and normalization conditions for the radiation modes are derived using a general formalism which yields a relationship between free-space and modal fields valid in a much wider class of systems than those of specific interest here. These orthonormality conditions are used in Chapter 3 to study the excitation and propagation of the radiation modes within a circular dielectric rod. The first source used is a truncated plane wave. The effects of changing the angle of incidence or the extent of the source field are studied. A close analogy is found between the far-field radiation pattern of a dielectric waveguide with small dielectric-constant-difference between core and cladding and the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture. Similar calculations are then repeated with a quasi-monochromatic, totally incoherent source. In Chapter 4, the transformation is made from the transverse spectral representation of the waveguide field to a longitudinal representation. A steepest-descent approximation is then made by which the integral over the continuum of radiation modes is replaced, within a restricted region, by a sum over discrete, improper, unbound modes - leaky modes - plus a saddle-point contribution. The leaky modes are shown to be the analytic continuation of bound modes below cutoff and the range of significance of the saddle-point term is estimated. Two methods for determining the orthogonality and excitation of leaky modes are investigated. The detailed characteristics of leaky modes are studied, both numerically and asymptotically in Chapter 5. Using these characteristics, the excitation and propagation of the radiation field are studied in terms of leaky modes under the same excitation conditions as used in Chapter 3. These results are used to estimate the range of validity of the leaky ray theory. The number of leaky modes with a given attenuation and the effect on this attenuation of including material absorption are also discussed. In Chapter 6, some of the above ideas are applied to the optical waveguides in visual photoreceptors. The contribution of unbound modes to light absorption in these structures is investigated and an ambiguity in the method of determining photoreceptor parameters by observation of mode cutoffs is pointed out" The major conclusions of the thesis are summarized in Chapter 7.</dc:description>

          <dc:title>Short-range order in ferroelectric triglycine sulphate</dc:title>
          <dc:creator>Hudspeth, Jessica Mary</dc:creator>
          <dc:description>he short-range order in triglycine sulphate (TGS) was investigated using x-ray and neutron di raction techniques. Complete deuteration of TGS was required for the neutron di raction experiments and a new method was developed to grow single crystals of fully deuterated TGS by vapour di usion crystallisation. The long-range structure of fully deuterated TGS was re ned at several temperatures from single crystal neutron di raction data and found to be consistent with the published structure of hydrogenous TGS. The phase transition temperature was found to increase from about 322 K to about 334 K with complete deuteration. The evolution of the long-range structure with temperature was investigated using x-ray and neutron powder di raction. All of the lattice parameters had a single cusp at the phase transition, except for the b lattice parameter, which also had a second cusp about 34 K below TC. In contrast to the lattice parameter behaviour, the unit cell volume was found to increase monotonically with temperature. The length of the hydrogen bonds between the disordered N atom on glycine 1 (G1) and the surrounding molecules was found to increase with temperature, whereas the length of the short hydrogen bond between G2 and G3 decreased slightly with temperature. This supports the suggestion that weakening of the hydrogen bonds decouples G1 from G2 and G3, allowing the system to become disordered. Except around the ferroelectric to paraelectric phase transition temperature, no abnormalities in the behaviour of any of the re ned parameters were observed, suggesting that TGS only has a single phase transition. The short-range order in TGS was investigated by collecting single crystal x-ray and neutron di use scattering at several temperatures from well below to well above TC. Well below TC, the di use scattering was purely thermal di use scattering due to correlations of the atomic displacements. Close to the phase vii viii transition, di use streaks perpendicular to b were also present in the di use scattering patterns, which were due to short-range order of the G1 orientations parallel to the ferroelectric b axis. The onset of signi cant short-range order appears to occur about 40 K below TC. The correlations are strongest at the phase transition and then decrease with temperature above TC. The short-range order was modelled using a combination of a displacive disorder and an orientational disorder Monte Carlo simulation. The intermolecular interactions that give rise to correlated atomic displacements were modelled by treating them like Hooke's law springs. The force constants for the interactions were parameterised in a number of ways, the most successful of which was an empirical formula developed by Chan et al. The short-range order of the G1 orientations was modelled using an Ising-type model. The G1 interactions that lead to short-range order along the ferroelectric b axis appear to be mediated by the short hydrogen bond between G2 and G3. This suggests that the hydrogen bonding, rather than the dipole-dipole interactions, plays the dominant role in the ferroelectric ordering of TGS. While the hydrogen bonding gives rise to strongly correlated chains of G1 molecules along b, it is likely that there are also weaker correlations between the chains due to dipole-dipole interactions. This provides a mechanism for TGS to go from short-range ordered in 1-dimension, to long-range ordered in 3-dimensions as it is cooled through TC.</dc:description>
