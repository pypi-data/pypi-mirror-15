"""
Core functionality of the `executor` package.

If you're looking for an easy way to run external commands from Python take a
look at the :func:`execute()` function. When you need more flexibility consider
using the underlying :class:`ExternalCommand` class directly instead.

:func:`execute()` versus :class:`ExternalCommand`
-------------------------------------------------

In :mod:`executor` 1.x the :func:`execute()` function was the only interface
for external command execution. This had several drawbacks:

- The documentation for the :func:`execute()` function was getting way too
  complex given all of the supported options and combinations.

- There was no way to execute asynchronous external commands (running in the
  background) without sidestepping the complete :mod:`executor` module and
  going straight for :class:`subprocess.Popen` (with all of the verbosity
  that you get for free with :mod:`subprocess` :-).

- There was no way to prepare an external command without starting it
  immediately, making it impossible to prepare a batch of external commands
  before starting them (whether synchronously or asynchronously).

To solve these problems :mod:`executor` 2.x introduced the
:class:`ExternalCommand` class. This explains why :func:`execute()` is now a
trivial wrapper around :class:`ExternalCommand`: It's main purpose is to be an
easy to use shortcut that preserves compatibility with the old interface.

This variable isn't based on the ``$SHELL`` environment variable because:

1. Shells like ``sh``, ``dash``, ``bash`` and ``zsh`` all have their own
   subtly incompatible semantics.
2. People regularly use shells like ``fish`` as their default login shell :-).

At an interactive prompt this is no problem (advanced users have obviously
learned to context switch) but when you're writing source code the last thing
you want to worry about is which shell is going to evaluate your commands! The
:mod:`executor` package expects this shell to support the following features:

- The ``-c`` option to evaluate a shell command provided as a command line
  argument.

- The ``-`` argument to instruct the shell to read shell commands from its
  standard input stream and evaluate those.

Apart from these two things nothing else is expected from the default shell so
you're free to customize it if you really want to write your shell commands in
``fish`` or ``zsh`` syntax :-).

def execute(*command, **options):

    Execute an external command and make sure it succeeded.

    :param command: All positional arguments are passed on to the constructor
                    of :class:`ExternalCommand`.
    :param options: All keyword arguments are passed on to the constructor of
                    :class:`ExternalCommand`.
    :returns: Refer to :func:`execute_prepared()`.
    :raises: :exc:`ExternalCommandFailed` when the command exits with a
             nonzero exit code (and :attr:`~ExternalCommand.check` is
             :data:`True`).

    If :attr:`~ExternalCommand.async` is :data:`True` then :func:`execute()`
    will automatically start the external command for you using
    :func:`~ExternalCommand.start()` (but it won't wait for it to end). If you
    want to create an :class:`ExternalCommand` object instance without
    immediately starting the external command then you can use
    :class:`ExternalCommand` directly.

    **Some examples**

    By default the status code of the external command is returned as a boolean:

    >>> from executor import execute
    >>> execute('true')
    True

    However when an external command exits with a nonzero status code an
    exception is raised, this is intended to "make it easy to do the right
    thing" (never forget to check the status code of an external command
    without having to write a lot of repetitive code):

    >>> execute('false')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "executor/__init__.py", line 124, in execute
        cmd.start()

        raise ExternalCommandFailed(self)
    executor.ExternalCommandFailed: External command failed with exit code 1! (command: false)

    What's also useful to know is that exceptions raised by :func:`execute()`
    expose :attr:`~ExternalCommandFailed.command` and
    :attr:`~ExternalCommandFailed.returncode` attributes. If you know a command
    is likely to exit with a nonzero status code and you want :func:`execute()`
    to simply return a boolean you can do this instead:

        The value if this property is :data:`True` when the process is running
        or :data:`False` otherwise (whether the process hasn't been started yet
        or has already finished). This property has two implementations (listed
        by order of preference):

        1. If :attr:`subprocess` is available :func:`~subprocess.Popen.poll()`
           is used to determine whether the process is currently running. The
           advantage of this approach is that it works on UNIX and Windows
           systems alike. A disadvantage of this approach is that the current
           process by definition needs to be a parent of the process in
           question.

        2. If :attr:`pid` is available the signal number zero is sent to the
           process with that process ID and the result is used to infer whether
           the process is alive or not (this technique is documented in `man
           kill`_):

           - If the sending of the signal doesn't raise an exception the
             process received the signal just fine and so must it exist.

           - If an :exc:`~exceptions.OSError` exception with error number
             :data:`~errno.EPERM` is raised we don't have permission to signal
             the process, which implies that the process is alive.

           - If an :exc:`~exceptions.OSError` exception with error number
             :data:`~errno.ESRCH` is raised we know that no process with the
             given id exists.

           An advantage of this approach (on UNIX systems) is that you don't
           need to be a parent of the process in question. A disadvantage of
           this approach is that it is never going to work on Windows (if
           you're serious about portability consider using a package like
           psutil_).

                        time window, but when it isn't it can be really
                        confusing.

class ExternalCommand(ControllableProcess):

    """
    Programmer friendly :class:`subprocess.Popen` wrapper.

    The :class:`ExternalCommand` class wraps :class:`subprocess.Popen` to make
    it easier to do the right thing (the simplicity of :func:`os.system()` with
    the robustness of :class:`subprocess.Popen`) and to provide additional
    features (e.g. asynchronous command execution that preserves the ability to
    provide input and capture output).

    :class:`ExternalCommand` inherits from :class:`ControllableProcess` so all
    of the process manipulation supported by :class:`ControllableProcess` is
    also supported by :class:`ExternalCommand` objects.

    Because the :class:`ExternalCommand` class has a lot of properties and
    methods here is a summary:

    **Writable properties**
     The :attr:`async`, :attr:`callback`, :attr:`capture`,
     :attr:`capture_stderr`, :attr:`check`, :attr:`directory`,
     :attr:`encoding`, :attr:`environment`, :attr:`fakeroot`, :attr:`input`,
     :attr:`logger`, :attr:`merge_streams`, :attr:`shell`, :attr:`silent`,
     :attr:`stdout_file`, :attr:`stderr_file`, :attr:`uid`, :attr:`user`,
     :attr:`sudo` and :attr:`virtual_environment` properties allow you to
     configure how the external command will be run (before it is started).

    **Computed properties**
     The :attr:`command`, :attr:`command_line`, :attr:`decoded_stderr`,
     :attr:`decoded_stdout`, :attr:`encoded_input`, :attr:`error_message`,
     :attr:`error_type`, :attr:`failed`, :attr:`have_superuser_privileges`,
     :attr:`is_finished`, :attr:`is_running`, :attr:`is_terminated`,
     :attr:`output`, :attr:`result`, :attr:`returncode`, :attr:`stderr`,
     :attr:`stdout`, :attr:`succeeded` and :attr:`was_started` properties allow
     you to inspect if and how the external command was started, what its
     current status is and what its output is.

    **Public methods**
     The public methods :func:`start()`, :func:`wait()`, :func:`terminate()`
     and :func:`kill()` enable you to start external commands, wait for them to
     finish and terminate them if they take too long.

    **Internal methods**
     The internal methods :func:`check_errors()`, :func:`load_output()` and
     :func:`cleanup()` are used by :func:`start()`, :func:`wait()` and
     :func:`terminate()` so unless you're reimplementing one of those methods
     you probably don't need these internal methods.

    **Context manager**
      :class:`ExternalCommand` objects can be used as context managers by using
      the :keyword:`with` statement:

      - When the scope of the :keyword:`with` statement starts the
        :func:`start()` method is called (if the external command
        isn't already running).
      - When the scope of the :keyword:`with` statement ends
        :func:`terminate()` is called if the command is still running. The
        :func:`load_output()` and :func:`cleanup()` functions are used to
        cleanup after the external command. If an exception isn't already being
        raised :func:`check_errors()` is called to make sure the external
        command succeeded.
    """

        """

          time.

          file and the standard input stream of the external command is
          connected to read from the temporary file.

          By using a temporary file the external command can consume its input
          as fast or slow as it pleases without needing a separate thread or
          process to "feed" the external command.

        - When :class:`capture` is :data:`True` the standard output of the
          external command is redirected to a temporary file whose contents are
          read once the external command has finished.
