Murdock: A Molecular Docking Framework
======================================

Murdock is a Python package for the development and testing of automated
`molecular docking`_ solutions. It has been developed as a convenient and
efficient platform to implement new search algorithms, scoring functions,
multi-step docking workflows and other features on a reliable platform, test
them quickly and use the rich output to analyse advantages, disadvantages and
issues of a new method. In addition, Murdock comes with a set of end-user
scripts and presets, so that it can be used by anyone solemly to obtain
scientific data, for which only a basic knowledge of command-line tools is
required.

.. note::

    Murdock is developed in the `Pisabarro Lab`_ at the BIOTEC, TU Dresden. We
    use it as a platform to develop a docking method for
    Glycosaminoglycan-Protein complexes. Hence, all search and scoring methods
    implemented have primarily been optimized and tested on these systems.

.. warning::

    The current Murdock version and (especially) its documentation are at an
    alpha stage. The software is not yet ready for production.

Please refer to the `documentation`_ to get started.
