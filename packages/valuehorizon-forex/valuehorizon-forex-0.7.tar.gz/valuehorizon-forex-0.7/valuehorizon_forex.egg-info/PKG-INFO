        A Django-based Foreign Exchange data toolkit. It provides time-series functionality
        with built-in statistical plugins such as volatility and returns. You can also write 
        your own statistical plugins.
        It also includes documentation, test coverage and a good amount of sample data to play around with.
        This app is a part of the Valuehorizon application ecosystem.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Start by creating a new ``virtualenv`` for your project ::
        
            mkvirtualenv myproject
        
        Next install ``numpy`` and ``pandas`` and optionally ``scipy`` ::
        
            pip install numpy==1.1.0
            pip install pandas==0.13.0
        
        Finally, install ``valuehorizon-forex`` using ``pip``::
        
            pip install valuehorizon-forex
        
        Usage
        ============
        
        Let's start by loading some sample data.::
        
            python manage.py load_fixtures --settings=my_settings_file
        
        This dataset contains the exchange rate data for the US Dollar to Euro (USD/EUR) from 2013-01-01 to 2015-12-31. In a 
        django shell, we can try the following::
        
            euro = Currency.objects.get(symbol="EUR")
