Perfmetrics configuration for Zope and Plone
============================================

zperfmetrics works like and depends on `perfmetrics <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/perfmetrics>`_, additional it:

- offers a ZConfig configuration for the statsd,
- uses the current requests path in the statd dotted path prefix,
- also provides a patch to measure plone.app.theming for diazo compile and diazo transform if Plone is available,


Installation
============

First get your ``statsd`` configured properly.
This is out of scope of this module.

Depend on this module in your packages ``setup.py``.

Given you use ``zc.builodut`` to set up your Zope2 or Plone,
add to your ``[instance]`` section or the section with ``recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance`` the lines::

    [instance01]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zope-conf-imports =
        zperfmetrics
    zope-conf-additional =
        <perfmetrics>
            uri statsd://localhost:8125
            before MyFancyProject
            hostname on
            after ${:_buildout_section_name_}
        </perfmetrics>
    ...

Given this runs on a host called ``w-plone1``,
this will result in a prefix ``MyFancyProject.w-plone1.instance01``

uri
    Full URI of statd.

before
    Prefix path before the hostname.

hostname
    Get hostname and insert into prefix. (Boolean: ``on`` or ``off``)

after
    Prefix path after the hostname.


Usage
=====

You need to decorate your code or use the ``with`` statement to measure a code block.

Usage::

    from zperfmetrics import ZMetric
    from zperfmetrics import zmetric
    from zperfmetrics import zmetricmethod

    @zmetric
    def some_function():
        # whole functions timing and call counts will be measured
        pass

    @ZMetric(stat='a_custom_prefix')
    def some_other_function():
        # set a custom prefix instead of module path and fucntion name.
        pass

    class Foo(object):

        @zmetricmethod
        def some_method(self):
            # whole methods timing and call counts will be measured
            pass

        @ZMetric(method=True, timing=False):
        def some_counted_method(self):
            # whole methods number of calls will be measured, but no times
            pass

        @ZMetric(method=True, count=False):
        def some_timed_method(self):
            # whole methods timing be measured, but no counts
            pass

        def some_method_partly_measured(self):
            # do something here you dont want to measure
            with ZMetric(stat='part_of_other_method_time'):
                # do something to measure
                # call counts and timing will be measured
                pass
            # do something here you dont want to measure

        @ZMetric(method=True, rate=0.5):
        def some_random_recorded_method(self):
            # randomly record 50% of the calls.
            pass


Zope Request Integration
========================

This package provides subscribers to measure the time a request takes,
including some points in time between.

These subscribers are loaded via zcml and are logging under ``request.*``:

``request.traversal``
    time needed from publication start until traversal is finished.

``request.beforecommit``
    time needed from publication start until database commit is begins.

``request.success``
    time needed from publication start until while request was processed.


Plone Patches
=============

This package provides two default patches:

plone.app.theming.transform.ThemeTransform.setupTransform
    is patched as a basic (path-less) perfmetrics ``Metric`` under the name ``diazo.compile``.

plone.app.theming.transform.ThemeTransform.transformIterable
    is patched as a zperfmetrics ``ZMetric`` under the name ``diazo.transform``.


Source Code
===========

The sources are in a GIT DVCS with its main branches at `github <https://github.com/collective/zperfmetrics>`_.

We'd be happy to see many branches, forks and pull-requests to make zperfmetrics even better.
