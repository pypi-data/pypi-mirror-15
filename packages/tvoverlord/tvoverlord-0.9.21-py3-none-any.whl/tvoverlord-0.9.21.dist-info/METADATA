TV Overlord is a command line tool to download and manage TV shows
from newsgroups or bittorent.  It will download nzb files or magnet
links.

It searches multiple sites simultaneously and combines the results into
one list to select from.

TV Overlord keeps track of which shows have been downloaded and what
shows are available to download.

For each new episode of a tv show you are tracking, you are given a
list of possible downloads to choose.  If you use a torrent search
provider, a magnet link is passed to the default bittorent client.  If
it is an NZB search, an NZB file is placed in a folder that is
configured in the configuration file.

For torrent files, you can also have your shows organized after
downloading.  If you use transmission or deluge, those clients can be
configured to call a script when each torrent is complete.  This
script will extract the video file from the downloaded folder, rename
it, and put it in a seperate folder organized into sub folders named
for each tv show.

There are several bittorent search providers and two NZB search
providers and new ones can be added fairly easily.  See the
search providers [[https://github.com/8cylinder/tv-overlord/tree/master/tv/search_providers][README.org]], or by making a feature request in issues
or a pull request.


**** Requirements

Python3 on Linux or OSX


** Features

+ Keeps track of downloaded shows
+ Show a list of shows available for download
+ Gives you a list of torrents or nzbs you can choose from
+ You can add new shows from the command line
+ Will display info showing what show will be next and how many days
  till broadcast.  This list can be filtered and sorted in various ways
+ Displays a calendar of upcoming episodes.  You can also specify a range
  of days to display, past or future.
+ The ability to query download history and re-start a download
+ Organize you tv show downloads into folders


** Install

TV Overlord has been tested on Linux and Mac.  It would probably not
be to hard to make it work on windows, and if anyone is interested, I
can take a look at making it work or alternatively send me a pull request.

TV Overlord is a python 3 application and can be installed via pip3.
If this method is used, all dependencies will be taken care of.

: sudo pip3 install tvoverlord

Or install it in your local user dir:
: pip3 --user install tvoverlord

If you use Bash as your shell, you can have completions.  Add this
to your .bashrc file:

: eval "$(_TVOL_COMPLETE=source tvol)"

After its installed, you run it by typing:

: tvol --help

The first time it's run, it will create the apropriate config dir for
your platform and put the database and config.ini there.

After that you can start to use it, type:

: tvol addnew 'Doctor Who'

If this is the wrong show, try again but add the year:

: tvol addnew 'Doctor Who 2005'

Then

: tvol download

**** Setup the post download script

If you use Tranmission or Deluge as your bittorent client there is a
script for each called transmission_done and deluge_done.  These will
take the episode that was downloaded and copy it to a folder where it
will be organized by show titles.

If you set the "clean torrents" setting in config.ini to "yes", the
largest file (which is the video file) will be extracted and renamed
to "show title SxxExx resolution.ext".  for example: "Fear the Walking
Dead S02E06 720p.mkv".  Otherwise whatever was downloaded gets copied.

To set this up in transmission, go to preferences, then downloading
and select the "call script when torrent is completed" then find the
"transmission_done" script.  Its location can be found by typing:

: which transmission_done

For Deluge use the execute plugin.  More information is available here:
http://dev.deluge-torrent.org/wiki/Plugins/Execute


** Configure

TV Overlord looks for the database and =config.ini= in the appropriate
directory for your platform.  When tvoverlord is first run, it will
create a tvoverlord directory there.

  + OSX will use ~/Library/Application Support/tvoverlord
  + Linux will use ~/.config/tvoverlord

*** Configuration file sections

=[App Settings]=
 + =ip: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx= \\
   If used, TV Overlord will issue a warning if not connected to a
   vpn.  This should be you ip address when *not* connected to a vpn, so
   if your current ip matches this one, the program stops.  It uses
   http://api.ipify.org to get the current ip address.

 + =clean torrents: (yes|no)=\\
   If yes, the video file is extracted from the downloaded dir and
   renamed. For example:
   =Z.Nation.2x09.INTERNAL.720p.HDTV.x264-KILLERS[ettv].mkv= will be
   renamed to "=Z Nation S02E09 720p.mkv=" and then copied to the "=tv
   dir=" (description below).  If that directory doesn't have a dir
   called "Z Nation", it's created.

   If no, then whatever was downloaded gets copied to the "tv dir" and
   put into the "Z Nation" directory

 + =search type: (torrent|newsgroup)=\\
   search type can be torrent or newsgroup.  If it's unspecified, it
   will use torrent

=[File Locations]=
 + =tv dir: FILEPATH= \\
   If you use the transmission_done or deluge_done scripts, then
   this is where the finished video files will be copied to and
   organized into folders under the show's name

 + =staging: FILEPATH= \\
   If using NZB searches, this is where the NZB files will be put.


** How to use

**** Add new

: tvol addnew SHOWNAME

TV Overlord will search thetvdb.com for a match to your show name.  If
it can't find the show you are looking for, it usually helps to add the
year to the name: =tvol addnew 'show name year';=.

**** Show missing

: tvol showmissing [--today]

This will list any shows that are available to download.

 + =--no-cache= will use fresh info from thetvdb.com instead of using the
   cached data (which is valid for 4 hours)
 + =--today= will show info for today instead of the usuall which is to
   only show yesterday's and older

**** Download

: tvol download [--today] [--ignore-warning] [--count NUM]
:               [--location FILEPATH] [--provider NAME] [SHOWNAME]

For each show thats ready to download, it will ask you which one you
want to download.

 + =--count=  sets the number of results to display, the default is 5.
 + =--location=  sets the dir to download the nzb files to if you are using
   an nzb search engine.  This can be set in the ini file
 + =--provider=  will set the provider to use.  Look in the ini file to see
   how that can be specified there.  NAME can be a partial name
 + =--no-cache= will use fresh info from thetvdb.com instead of using the
   cached data (which is valid for 4 hours)
 + =--today= will show info for today instead of the usuall which is to
   only show yesterday's and older
 + =--ignore-warning= does not check if you are connected to a vpn.
   This is documented in the tv_config.ini section


And finally, you can specify a single show to only download that show
instead of downloading all.

**** Calendar

: tvol calendar [--today] [--sort-by-next]
:               [--no-color] [--days DAYS[,AFTER]] [SHOWNAME]

Display a calendar of all the current shows in your database.  It
defaults to the width of the console.

 + =--sort-by-next= sorts by order of next episode instead of by name.
 + =--days DAYS= will narrow the calendar to DAYS days.  For example,
   =--days 10= will show the next 10 days only.
 + =--days DAYS,AFTER= will display from DAYS to AFTER days.  For
   example, =--days 10,5= will display from the 10th day to the 15th day.
 + =--no-cache= will use fresh info from thetvdb.com instead of using the
   cached data (which is valid for 4 hours)
 + =--today= will show info for today instead of the usuall which is to
   only show yesterday's and older

**** History

: tvol history (list [-w FIELDS]|copy|redownload) [CRITERIA]

- =CRITERIA= can be days, a date or a title or partial title
- =FIELDS= is a comma seperated list if fields to show that only works
  with the list command.  It may be any combination of these: date,
  title, season, episode, magnet, oneoff, complete, filename,
  destination.  If not specified it defaults to
  ='date,title,complete,destination'=.

The =list= command generates a tab seperated list.  This is usefull for
piping to various unix commands or for import into a spreadsheet.  For
example this command will format the output into columns.

: tvol history list -w 'title,date,complete' | column -ts$'\t'

=copy= and =redownload= show a list where the user can choose an episode to
redownload or recopy a file to the destination set in the ini file.

**** Info

: tvol info [--today] [--sort-by-next] [--show-links]
:           [--synopsis] [--ask-inactive] [SHOWNAME]

This will show you what shows are next, and how many days till they
are broadcast.  Called without arguments, it lists all show except
shows marked inactive, in alphabetical order.  A single show can be
specified also.

 + =--sort-by-next= this will sort the shows by order of which episodes are next
 + =--show-links= will display links to imdb.com and thetvdb.com for
   each show
 + =--synopsis= will show a show synopsis for each show
 + =--ask-inactive=  When a show has been completely downloaded, and it
   has been cancelled or ended, it will ask you if you want to mark it
   inactive.

**** Search and download non tracked

: tvol nondbshow [--count NUM] [--location FILEPATH]
:                [--provider NAME] SEARCHTERM

This will show you matches to your search.  Anything downloaded this
way will not be recorded in your database.

 + =--count= is the number of search results to display
 + =--location= is where to download nzb files to
 + =--provider= will set the provider to use.  NAME can be a partial name

**** Edit db info

: tvol editdbinfo SHOWNAME

Edit the data in the database for show name.  You can manually set a
show as 'inactive' here if you wish.

All episodes downloaded in the last year put into a file that can be
imported into any spreadsheet program.


** A note on pirating

Downloading shows via the Internet is much easier than watching them
on cable.  The shows are displayed in XBMC in a list and only the
shows I want to watch are listed.  This isn't about saving money, but
convenience.

The problem is that I don't want to be a thief by getting these shows
for free.  So, to make this work, I pay for the biggest cable package
I can, but I don't use it.  As far as I'm concerned, this is the same
as using TiVo and skipping the commercials.

If you want to download shows, you should do this too.
