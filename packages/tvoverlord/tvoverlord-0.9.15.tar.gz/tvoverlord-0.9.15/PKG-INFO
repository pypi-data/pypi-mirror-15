        TV Overlord is a command line tool to download and manage TV shows from
        newsgroups or bittorent.  It will download nzb files or magnet links.
        
        TV Overlord keeps track of which shows have been downloaded and what
        shows are available to download.
        
        For each new episode of a tv show you are tracking, you are given a list
        of possible downloads to choose.  If you use a torrent search provider,
        a magnet link is passed to the default bittorent client.  If it is an
        NZB search, an NZB file is placed in a folder that is configured in the
        configuration file.
        
        For torrent files, you can also have your shows organized after
        downloading.  If you use transmission or deluge, those clients can be
        configured to call a script when each torrent is complete.  This script
        will extract the video file from the downloaded folder, rename it, and
        put it in a seperate folder organized into sub folders named for each tv
        show.
        
        There are serveral bittorent search providers and two NZB search
        providers and new ones can be added fairly easily.  See the search
        providers [README.org], or by making a feature request in issues or a
        pull request.

        2 Install
        =========
        
          TV Overlord has been tested on Linux and Mac.  It would probably not
          be to hard to make it work on windows, and if anyone is interested, I
          can take a look at making it work or alternatively send me a pull
          request.
        
          TV Overlord is a python 3 application and can be installed via pip3.
          If this method is used, all dependencies will be taken care of.
        
          ,----
          | sudo pip3 install tvoverlord
          `----
        
          Otherwise if you want the most recent version you can install it
          manually:
        
          ,----
          | sudo pip3 install tvdb_api beautifulsoup4 feedparser requests docopt python-dateutil
          | git clone https://github.com/smmcg/tv-overlord.git
          | cd tv-overlord
          | # the following will install bash completions if you are using bash:
          | sudo cp tvoverlord_util/tvoverlord-completion.bash /etc/bash_completion.d/
          `----
        
          After its installed, you run it by typing:
        
          ,----
          | tvol
          `----
        
          And it will ask to create the config dir. Type `y' to allow it.  The
          config dir will be called `.tvoverlord/' and be in your home dir.
        
          After that you can start to use it, type:
        
          ,----
          | tvol addnew 'Doctor Who'
          `----
        
          If this is the wrong show, try again but add the year:
        
          ,----
          | tvol addnew 'Doctor Who 2005'
          `----
        
        
        2.1 Dependencies
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
          TV Overlord requires some additional python libraries (not part of the
          standard packages) to be installed:
          1. *tvdb_api* - [https://github.com/dbr/tvdb_api]
                  Python library to access the thetvdb.com api
          2. *Requests* - [http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/]
                  Library to download html pages
          3. *Beautiful Soup* -
              [http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/]
                  Python library used to scrap thepiratebay.org since they don't
                  have an api
          4. *Feedparser* - [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/feedparser]
                  For sites that provide an xml api this library is used to
                  parse them
          5. *Docopt* - [http://docopt.org/]
                  The best library for handling command line arguments

        3 How to use
        ============
        
        3.0.1 Add new
        -------------
        
          ,----
          | tvol addnew SHOWNAME
          `----
        
          TV Overlord will search thetvdb.com for a match to your show name.  If
          it can't find the show you are looking for, it usually helps to add
          the year to the name: `tvol addnew 'show name year';'.
        
        
        3.0.2 Show missing
        ------------------
        
          ,----
          | tvol showmissing [--no-cache] [--today]
          `----
        
          This will list any shows that are available to download.
        
          + `--no-cache' will use fresh info from thetvdb.com instead of using
            the cached data (which is valid for 4 hours)
          + `--today' will show info for today instead of the usuall which is to
            only show yesterday's and older
        
        
        3.0.3 Download
        --------------
        
          ,----
          | tvol download [--no-cache] [--today] [--ignore-warning] [--count NUM]
          |               [--location FILEPATH] [--provider NAME] [SHOWNAME]
          `----
        
          For each show thats ready to download, it will ask you which one you
          want to download.
        
          + `--count' sets the number of results to display, the default is 5.
          + `--location' sets the dir to download the nzb files to if you are
            using an nzb search engine.  This can be set in the ini file
          + `--provider' will set the provider to use.  Look in the ini file to
            see how that can be specified there.  NAME can be a partial name
          + `--no-cache' will use fresh info from thetvdb.com instead of using
            the cached data (which is valid for 4 hours)
          + `--today' will show info for today instead of the usuall which is to
            only show yesterday's and older
          + `--ignore-warning' does not check if you are connected to a vpn.
            This is documented in the tv_config.ini section
        
        
          And finally, you can specify a single show to only download that show
          instead of downloading all.
        
        
        3.0.4 Calendar
        --------------
        
          ,----
          | tvol calendar [--no-cache] [--today] [--sort-by-next]
          |               [--no-color] [--days DAYS[,AFTER]] [SHOWNAME]
          `----
        
          Display a calendar of all the current shows in your database.  It
          defaults to the width of the console.
        
          + `--sort-by-next' sorts by order of next episode instead of by name.
          + `--days DAYS' will narrow the calendar to DAYS days.  For example,
            `--days 10' will show the next 10 days only.
          + `--days DAYS,AFTER' will display from DAYS to AFTER days.  For
            example, `--days 10,5' will display from the 10th day to the 15th
            day.
          + `--no-cache' will use fresh info from thetvdb.com instead of using
            the cached data (which is valid for 4 hours)
          + `--today' will show info for today instead of the usuall which is to
            only show yesterday's and older
        
        
        3.0.5 History
        -------------
        
          ,----
          | tvol history (list [-w FIELDS]|copy|redownload) [CRITERIA]
          `----
        
          - `CRITERIA' can be days, a date or a title or partial title
          - `FIELDS' is a comma seperated list if fields to show that only works
            with the list command.  It may be any combination of these: date,
            title, season, episode, magnet, oneoff, complete, filename.  If not
            specified it defaults to ='date,title,complete'=.
        
          The `list' command generates a tab seperated list.  This is usefull
          for piping to various unix commands.  For example this command will
          format the output into columns.
        
          ,----
          | tvol history list -w 'title,date,complete' | column -ts$'\t'
          `----
        
          `copy' and `redownload' show a list where the user can choose an
          episode to redownload or copy a file to the destination set in the ini
          file.
        
        
        3.0.6 Info
        ----------
        
          ,----
          | tvol info [--no-cache] [--today] [--sort-by-next] [--show-links]
          |           [--synopsis] [--ask-inactive] [SHOWNAME]
          `----
        
          This will show you what shows are next, and how many days till they
          are broadcast.  Called without arguments, it lists all show except
          shows marked inactive, in alphabetical order.  A single show can be
          specified also.
        
          + `--sort-by-next' this will sort the shows by order of which episodes
            are next
          + `--show-links' will display links to imdb.com and thetvdb.com for
            each show
          + `--synopsis' will show a show synopsis for each show
          + `--ask-inactive' When a show has been completely downloaded, and it
            has been cancelled or ended, it will ask you if you want to mark it
            inactive.
        
        
        3.0.7 Search and download non tracked
        -------------------------------------
        
          ,----
          | tvol nondbshow [--count NUM] [--location FILEPATH]
          |                [--provider NAME] SEARCHTERM
          `----
        
          This will show you matches to your search.  Anything downloaded this
          way will not be recorded in your database.
        
          + `--count' is the number of search results to display
          + `--location' is where to download nzb files to
          + `--provider' will set the provider to use.  NAME can be a partial
            name
        
        
        3.0.8 Providers
        ---------------
        
          ,----
          | tvol providers
          `----
        
          This will list search providers available to the program.  The default
          one is the provider at the top of the list in config.ini.
        
        
        3.0.9 Edit db info
        ------------------
        
          ,----
          | tvol editdbinfo SHOWNAME
          `----
        
          Edit the data in the database for show name.  You can manually set a
          show as 'inactive' here if you wish.
        
        
        4 Configure
        ===========
        
          TV Overlord looks for the database and `config.ini' in the
          `~/.tv_overlord/' directory.  If that directory doesn't exist, the app
          will create it.
        
        
        4.1 Configuration file sections
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
          `[App Settings]'
          + `ip: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx'
               If used, TV Overlord will issue a warning if not connected to a
            vpn.  This should be you ip address when *not* connected to a vpn,
            so if your current ip matches this one, the program stops.  It uses
            [http://api.ipify.org] to get the current ip address.
        
          + `clean torrents: (yes|no)'
               If yes, the video file is extracted from the downloaded dir and
            renamed. For example:
            `Z.Nation.2x09.INTERNAL.720p.HDTV.x264-KILLERS[ettv].mkv' will be
            renamed to "`Z Nation S02E09 720p.mkv'" and then copied to the "`tv
            dir'" (description below).  If that directory doesn't have a dir
            called "Z Nation", it's created.
        
            If no, then whatever was downloaded gets copied to the "tv dir" and
            put into the "Z Nation" directory
        
          `[Search Providers]'
          + This is a list of search providers that come with the application.
            The first one is the default.  The search engine used can be
            overridden on the command line with `--provider=PROVIDERNAME'
        
          `[File Locations]'
          + `db file: FILEPATH'
               The location of the database.
          + `tv dir: FILEPATH'
               If specified, this is where the post download script will put the
            episodes.
          + `staging: FILEPATH'
               If using NZB searches, this is where the NZB files will be put.

        7 A note on pirating
        ====================
        
          Downloading shows via the Internet is much easier than watching them
          on cable.  The shows are displayed in XBMC in a list and only the
          shows I want to watch are listed.  This isn't about saving money, but
          convenience.
        
          The problem is that I don't want to be a thief by getting these shows
          for free.  So, to make this work, I pay for the biggest cable package
          I can, but I don't use it.  As far as I'm concerned, this is the same
          as using TiVo and skipping the commercials.
        
          If you want to download shows, you should do this too.
