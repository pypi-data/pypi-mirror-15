        Tired of reading through CI console logs to find your lint errors? Inline your lint messages in your diffs!
        
        * Free software: ISC license
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Run linters against your code and comment in your diffs at the failing lines
        * Automatically run linters with reasonable default configs
        * Easy to add new linter configurations
        
        How to use
        ----------
        
        ::
        
          pip install inlineplz
          inline-plz --install --autorun
        
        
        You probably want to run the above in a CI job, not in your regular development environment. 
        
        You'll also need to provide the following either in the command line or via environment variables:
        
        * owner: the repo organization/owner
        * repo: the repo name
        * token: your auth token (encrypt this, don't put this in plaintext in any public configurations!)
        * url: the url of your scm host
        * interface: the type of scm host (such as github)
        
        Dependencies:
        
        * node.js / npm
        * ruby / gem
        * python / pip
        
        Known issues
        ------------
        
        * Currently for Travis-CI usage, inline-plz only works for PRs within the original repo, not PRs from forks. This is because encrypted creds in Travis-CI configs are encrypted per repo, and cannot be decrypted in PRs from forks.
        * Currently the inline-plz console output can print out some misleading stack traces
        * Currently dependencies get installed globally unless you pre-create a virtualenv
        * Commits directly to master are not currently supported
