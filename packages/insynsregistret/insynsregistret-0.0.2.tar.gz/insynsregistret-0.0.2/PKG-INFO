        Introduction
        ------------
        `Insynsregistret <http://insynsok.fi.se>`_  is a Swedish financial registry maintained by the `Swedish Finansinspektionen <http://www.fi.se>`_ (FI). It contains
        information regarding insider trading on the Stockholm Stock Exchange (OMX) which is the largest financial market in Sweden.
        
        All insider trading is reported to FI, which publishes the data to this public database. This python library makes it easier to automate data extraction from Insynsregistret.
        
        Please note that this library currently is under development. See the tests for usage instructions.
