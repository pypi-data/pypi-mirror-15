Description: pyramid-avro
        ============
        
        This project is a Pyramid plugin built for integrating Avro protocol files into a pyramid application.
        
        Python 3 Support
        ----------------
        Unfortunately it is not yet available, as this plugin depends on Apache's [avro](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/avro/) library.
        Python3 support will come in later versions.
        
        A Note On Compilation
        ---------------------
        
        While this plugin provides for auto-compiling your avro protocol into an avro schema, this is rarely something you'd want in all environments your application might be deployed into.
        
        When defining a service configuration, you **must have at least a schema defined**.
        This means that the protocol file itself isn't actually ever required **UNLESS** the auto_compile flag is turned on.
        
        For non-development configs, we suggest compiling your schema files prior to deployments and simply specifying them in your config rather turning auto_compile on.
        
        Lastly, the tools jar must be provided by you, the developer, not this plugin.
        In addition to not wanting a compilation at runtime in non-dev environments, you probably don't want that jar hanging around either.
