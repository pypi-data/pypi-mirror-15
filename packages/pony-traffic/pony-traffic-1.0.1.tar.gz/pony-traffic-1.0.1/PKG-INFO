        As well as a site statistics module, with the active_users template tag and manager method you can also use django-request to show who is online in a certain time. ::
        
            Request.objects.active_users(minutes=15)
        
        To find the request overview page, please click on Requests inside the admin, then “Overview” on the top right, next to “add”.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        - Put `'request'`  and `'request.tracking'` in your INSTALLED_APPS setting.
        - Run the command `manage.py syncdb`.
        - Add `request.middleware.RequestMiddleware` to `MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`. If you use `django.contrib.auth`, place the RequestMiddleware after it. If you use `django.contrib.flatpages` place `request.middleware.RequestMiddleware` before it else flatpages will be marked as error pages in the admin panel.
        - Make sure that the domain name in `django.contrib.sites` admin is correct. This is used to calculate unique visitors and top referrers.
