# pyDownloader

## Description

The pyDownloader module was designed to download files via every known protocols and usable by other python 
modules / applications. A usage example is someone want's to create a web page where he inputs a URL and let a machine
handle the download to a storage array.

Everyone is free to participate on this module's development and once the basic protocols are implemented, I will post
it on pypi. Please check the issues section to see if someone else has already started working on a protocol module.
