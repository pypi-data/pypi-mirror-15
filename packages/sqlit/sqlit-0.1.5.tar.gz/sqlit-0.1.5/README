sqlit
=====

Doesn't do anything much yet, why are you even, I don't even.

Designed for quick operations on sqlite files, abused as a sort of lightly typed
csv file.  To have fun with sqlit:

 1. Have non-enormous data
 2. Use a single table per sqlite file
 3. Use sqlit to run queries across those files (using sqlite's ATTACH DATABASE
    feature) and store results in another sqlite file
 4. Use a Makefile to control flow
