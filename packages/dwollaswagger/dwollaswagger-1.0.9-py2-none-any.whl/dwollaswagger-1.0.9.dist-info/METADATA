be installed automagically via
`pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html>`__.

*To install via pip:*

::

    pip install dwollaswagger

*To add to ``requirements.txt`` and make this a permanent dependency of
your package:*

.. code:: requirements.txt

    YourApp
    SomeLibrary==1.2.3
    dwollaswagger>=1.0.0

*OS X users may need to run ``setup.py`` as a privileged user.*

Quickstart
----------

``dwollaswagger`` makes it easy for developers to hit the ground running
with our API. Before attempting the following, you should ideally create
`an application key and secret <https://www.dwolla.com/applications>`__.

Configuring a client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get started, all you need to set is the ``access_token`` and ``host``
values.

.. code:: python

    dwollaswagger.configuration.access_token = 'token'

    # For UAT/Sandbox
    client = dwollaswagger.ApiClient('https://api-uat.dwolla.com')

    # For Production
    client = dwollaswagger.ApiClient('https://api.dwolla.com')

List 10 customers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that we've set up our client, we can use it to make requests to the
API. Let's retrieve 10 customer records associated with the
authorization token used.

.. code:: python

    dwollaswagger.configuration.access_token = 'token'
    client = dwollaswagger.ApiClient('https://api-uat.dwolla.com')

    customers_api = dwollaswagger.CustomersApi(client)
    my_custies =  customers_api.list(limit=10)

``my_custies`` will be a Python list that consists of ``Customer``
objects.

Creating a new customer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a customer, we can either provide a ``dict`` with the expected
values, or a ``CreateCustomer`` object.

.. code:: python

    customers_api = dwollaswagger.CustomersApi(client)

    location = customers_api.create(body = {
        'firstName': "Jennifer",
        'lastName': "Smith",
        'email': "jsmith@gmail.com",
        'phone': "7188675309"})

or
^^

.. code:: python

    customers_api = dwollaswagger.CustomersApi(client)

    new_cust = dwollaswagger.CreateCustomer
    new_cust.first_name = "Jennifer"
    new_cust.last_name = "Smith"
    new_cust.email = "jsmith@gmail.com"
    new_cust.phone = "7188675309"

    location = customers_api.create(body=new_cust)

``location`` will contain a URL to your newly created resource (HTTP 201
/ Location header).

Modules
-------

``dwolla-python-swagger`` contains ``API`` modules which allow the user
to make requests, as well as ``models`` which are
`DAOs <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_access_object>`__ that the
library uses to serialize responses.

API
~~~

Each API module is named in accordance to (`Dwolla's API
Spec <http://docsv2.dwolla.com/>`__ and encapsulates all of the
documented functionality.

-  ``AccountsApi``
-  ``BusinessclassificationsApi``
-  ``CustomersApi``
-  ``DocumentsApi``
-  ``EventsApi``
-  ``FundingsourcesApi``
-  ``RootApi``
-  ``TransfersApi``
-  ``WebhooksApi``
-  ``WebhooksubscriptionsApi``

--------------

API objects take an ``ApiClient`` argument, which you created
`here <##Configuring%20a%20client>`__.

Example
^^^^^^^

.. code:: python

    doc_api = dwollaswagger.DocumentsApi(your_client_object)

Models
~~~~~~

Each model represents the different kinds of requests and responses that
can be made with the Dwolla API.

-  ``AccountInfo``
-  ``Amount``
-  ``ApplicationEvent``
-  ``BaseObject``
-  ``BusinessClassification``
-  ``BusinessClassificationListResponse``
-  ``CreateCustomer``
-  ``CreateFundingSourceRequest``
-  ``CreateWebhook``
-  ``Customer``

-  ``Document``
-  ``DocumentListResponse``
-  ``EventListResponse``
-  ``FundingSource``
-  ``FundingSourceListResponse``
-  ``HalLink``

-  ``TransferRequestBody``
-  ``Unit``
-  ``UpdateCustomer``
-  ``VerificationToken``
-  ``VerifyMicroDepositsRequest``
-  ``Webhook``

README
------

In order for the library's README file to display nicely on PyPi, we
must use the ``*.rst`` file format. When making changes to this README
file, please `use this tool <http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/try/>`__
to convert the ``*.md`` file to ``*.rst``, and make sure to keep both
files updated.
