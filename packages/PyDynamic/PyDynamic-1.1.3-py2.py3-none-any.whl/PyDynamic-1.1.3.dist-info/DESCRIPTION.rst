Python package for the analysis of dynamic measurements
 The goal of this package is to provide a starting point for users in metrology and related areas who deal with time-dependent, i.e. *dynamic*, measurements.
The software is part of a joint research project of the national metrology institutes from Germany and the UK, i.e. [Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt](http://www.ptb.de/cms/en.html) and the [National Physical Laboratory](http://www.npl.co.uk).
