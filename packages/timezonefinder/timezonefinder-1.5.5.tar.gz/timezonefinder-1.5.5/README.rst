This is a fast and lightweight python project for looking up the corresponding
timezone for a given lat/lng on earth entirely offline.

This project is derived from and has been successfully tested against
`pytzwhere <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tzwhere/2.2>`__
(`github <https://github.com/pegler/pytzwhere>`__), but aims at providing
improved performance and usability.


The underlying timezone data is based on work done by `Eric
Muller <http://efele.net/maps/tz/world/>`__.

Timezones at sea and Antarctica are not yet supported (because somewhat
special rules apply there).

`timezone_finder <https://github.com/gunyarakun/timezone_finder>`__ is a ruby port of this package.


Dependencies
============

(``python``, ``math``, ``struct``, ``os``)

``numpy``


**Optional:**

``Numba`` and its Requirements

This is only for precompiling the time critical algorithms. When you only look up a
few points once in a while, the compilation time is probably outweighing
the benefits. When using ``certain_timezone_at()`` and especially
``closest_timezone_at()`` however, I highly recommend using ``numba``
(see speed comparison below)! The amount of shortcuts used in the
``.bin`` is also only optimized for the use with ``numba``.

Installation
============

(install the dependencies)

in your terminal simply:

::

    pip install timezonefinder

(you might need to run this command as administrator)



Usage
=====

Basics:
-------

::

    from timezonefinder import TimezoneFinder

    tf = TimezoneFinder()


for testing if numba is being used:
(if the import of the optimized algorithms worked)

::

    print(TimezoneFinder.using_numba())
    # this is a static method returning True or False


**fast algorithm:**

This approach is fast, but might not be what you are looking for:
For example when there is only one possible timezone in proximity, this timezone would be returned
(without checking if the point is included first).

::

    # point = (longitude, latitude)
    point = (13.358, 52.5061)
    print( tf.timezone_at(*point) )
    # = Europe/Berlin

**To make sure a point is really inside a timezone (slower):**

::

    print( tf.certain_timezone_at(*point) )
    # = Europe/Berlin

**To find the closest timezone (slow):**

::

    # only use this when the point is not inside a polygon!
    # this checks all the polygons within +-1 degree lng and +-1 degree lat
    point = (12.773955, 55.578595)
    print( tf.closest_timezone_at(*point) )
    # = Europe/Copenhagens

**To increase search radius even more (very slow, use numba!):**

::

    # this checks all the polygons within +-3 degree lng and +-3 degree lat
    # I recommend only slowly increasing the search radius
    # keep in mind that x degrees lat are not the same distance apart than x degree lng!
    print( tf.closest_timezone_at(lng=point[0],lat=point[1],delta_degree=3) )
    # = Europe/Copenhagens

(to make sure you really got the closest timezone increase the search
radius until you get a result. then increase the radius once more and
take this result.)

Further application:
--------------------

**To maximize the chances of getting a result in a** ``Django`` **view it might look like:**

::

    def find_timezone(request, lat, lng):
        lat = float(lat)
        lng = float(lng)

        try:
            timezone_name = tf.timezone_at(lng, lat)
            if timezone_name is None:
                timezone_name = tf.closest_timezone_at(lng, lat)
                # maybe even increase the search radius when it is still None

        except ValueError:
            # the coordinates were out of bounds
            # {handle error}

        # ... do something with timezone_name ...

**To get an aware datetime object from the timezone name:**

::

    # first pip install pytz
    from pytz import timezone, utc
    from pytz.exceptions import UnknownTimeZoneError

    # tzinfo has to be None (means naive)
    naive_datetime = YOUR_NAIVE_DATETIME

    try:
        tz = timezone(timezone_name)
        aware_datetime = naive_datetime.replace(tzinfo=tz)
        aware_datetime_in_utc = aware_datetime.astimezone(utc)

        naive_datetime_as_utc_converted_to_tz = tz.localize(naive_datetime)

    except UnknownTimeZoneError:
        # ... handle the error ...

also see the `pytz Doc <http://pytz.sourceforge.net/>`__.

**Using the conversion tool:**

Make sure you installed the GDAL framework (thats for converting .shp shapefiles into .json)
Change to the directory of the timezonefinder package (location of ``file_converter.py``) in your terminal and then:

::

    wget http://efele.net/maps/tz/world/tz_world.zip
    # on mac: curl "http://efele.net/maps/tz/world/tz_world.zip" -o "tz_world.zip"
    unzip tz_world
    ogr2ogr -f GeoJSON -t_srs crs:84 tz_world.json ./world/tz_world.shp
    rm ./world/ -r
    rm tz_world.zip


Credits to `cstich <https://github.com/cstich>`__.
There should be a tz_world.json (of approx. 100MB) in the folder together with the ``file_converter.py`` now.
Then run the converter by:

::

    python file_converter.py


This converts the .json into the needed ``.bin`` (overwriting the old version!) and also updates the ``timezone_names.py``.

**Please note:** Neither tests nor the file\_converter.py are optimized or
really beautiful. Sorry for that. If you have questions just write me (s. section 'Contact' below)

Comparison to pytzwhere
=======================

In comparison to
`pytzwhere <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tzwhere/2.2>`__ most notably initialisation time and memory usage are
significantly reduced, while the algorithms yield the same results and are as fast or event faster
(depending on the dependencies used, s. test results below).
In some cases ``pytzwhere``
even does not find anything and ``timezonefinder`` does, for example
when only one timezone is close to the point.

**Similarities:**

-  results

-  data being used


**Differences:**

-  highly decreased memory usage

-  highly reduced start up time

-  the data is now stored in a memory friendly 18MB ``.bin`` and needed
   data is directly being read on the fly (instead of reading, converting and KEEPING the 76MB ``.csv``
   -mostly floats stored as strings!- into
   memory every time a class is created).

-  precomputed shortcuts are stored in the ``.bin`` to quickly look up
   which polygons have to be checked (instead of computing and storing the shortcuts
   on every startup)

-  introduced proximity algorithm

-  use of ``numba`` for precompilation (almost reaching the speed of tzwhere with shapely on and keeping the hole data in the memory)

Known Issues
============

I ran tests for approx. 5M points and these are no mistakes I found.


Contact
=======

This is the first public python project I did, so most certainly there is stuff I missed,
things I could have optimized even further etc. That's why I would be really glad to get some feedback on my code.


If you notice that the tz data is outdated, encounter any bugs, have
suggestions, criticism, etc. feel free to **open an Issue**, **add a Pull Requests** on Git or ...

contact me: *python at michelfe dot it*
