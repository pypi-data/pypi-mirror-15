            ---------------------------------------
        
        
                Serve event data as server sent events.
        
                When the event header contains:
        
                If nobody is consuming events then they're lost.
                If <show_last> is set to True, then the last known value
                can be consumed by the client.
        
                Parameters:
        
                    - selection(str)("@data")
                       |  The part of the event to submit externally.
                       |  Use an empty string to refer to the complete event.
        
                    - bind(string)("0.0.0.0")
                       |  The address to bind to.
        
                    - port(int)(19283)
                       |  The port to bind to.
        
                    - show_last(bool)(False)
                       |  If true submits the last known value to
                       |  a new connection.
        
                    - keepalive(bool)(False)
                       |  If true sends a keepalive message at
                       |  <keepalive_interval> seconds.
        
                    - keepalive_interval(int)(False)
                       |  The time in seconds to send keep-alive
                       |  messages to the client.
        
                    - destination(str)("")*
                       |  The endpoint from which the event can be consumed.
        
        
                Queues:
        
                    - inbox
