Description: ===========================
        extpickle - extended pickle
        ===========================
        
        Extends the original `Pickler class <https://docs.python.org/ibrary/pickle.html>`_
        to be able to pickle some otherwise non-supported types.
        The emphasis is to be fast and for communication via pipes/sockets
        with the same Python version on the other end - thus we don't care that much for compatibility with other versions.
        
        A similar project is `dill <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dill>`_, which is much bigger though.
        
        This was used in the `TaskSystem project <https://github.com/albertz/TaskSystem>`_.
