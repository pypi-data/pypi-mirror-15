        Background information
        -----------------------
        
        When for example MS Office or PDF documents are stored in Plone as normal File content,
        document metadata embedded in the documents is not used. Such metadata is embedded
        inside the files in various type-specific formats, and might include information such as
        title, description and keywords, or EXIF/IPTC metadata for images. Nor does Plone provide
        a screenshot or cover page thumbnail of the document.
        
        This packages aims to provide those missing features in a generic, pluggable manner.
        
        Note that in addition to this package, you need additional packages to provide the actual
        file type - specific metadata extraction, such as:
        
        - Products.OpenXml for MS Office document support
        - collective.pdfdocument for PDF support
        
        
        Features provided
        ------------------
        
        - Generic pluggable mechanism to retrieve metadata from different file types, update
          content with it, and even round-trip the metadata back to the file from Plone content,
          if needed
        
        - Behavior to toggle the mechanism by content type
        
        - An example optional 'Document File' Dexterity content type that gets its metadata and
          cover image automatically copied over from the uploaded document file
        
        - Optionally enhanced built-in File content type so that it gets it metadata updated
          from uploaded file (including cover image)
        
        - A nicer default view (used both for the example type & enhanced File)
        
        Features not provided
        ----------------------
        
        - viewing the document contents
        
        - indexing of documents (would be a good fit though)
        
        - asynchronous operation
        
        
        Note on metadata and cover images
        ------------------------------------
        
        Usually people don't bother with document metadata so prior to uploading, you should check
        the document properties.
        
        For MS Office docs, make sure that the "store preview" option is selected, before saving
        the document. PDFs have no embedded cover image; for them,  collective.pdfdocument
        converts the first page of the PDF into a PNG cover image.
        
        
        Implementation notes
        ---------------------
        
        Metadata is processed by a subscriber that attemtps to retrieve the metadata using a 'IFileMetaProvider' utility whose name matches the primary file field mime type. If the
        metadata can be extracted from file, it is copied over by another 'IContentMetaUpdater'
        (likewise named) utility.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install collective.filemeta by adding it to your buildout::
        
            [buildout]
        
            ...
        
            eggs =
                collective.filemeta
        
        
        and then running ``bin/buildout``. Remember that you will also need some additional
        packages that provide the file type -specific extraction of document file metadata. For
        MS Office OpenXML and PDF support, the buildout would have::
        
            [buildout]
        
            ...
        
            eggs =
                collective.filemeta
                Products.OpenXml
                collective.pdfdocument
