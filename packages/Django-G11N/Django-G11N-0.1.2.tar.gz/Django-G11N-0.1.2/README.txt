Django Globalisation
####################

Application that provides helpful tools for globalisation efforts.
With this app you can:
- guess the origin country of the request
- return the currency a country uses
- fetch the language code

You don't need any commercial IP databases, this tool has commands to download
them from the original source, which is open data, just not that easily
available.
