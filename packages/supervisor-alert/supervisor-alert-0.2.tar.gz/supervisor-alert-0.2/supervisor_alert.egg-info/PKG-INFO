Description: supervisor-alert
        ================
        
        Are you using `Supervisor <http://supervisord.org>`__ to manage
        processes on a server? With supervisor-alert you can receive messages
        when the state of your processes change. Be the first to know when your
        services die!
        
        To send messages on Telegram you need to install and set up
        `telegram-send <https://github.com/rahiel/telegram-send>`__ first. You
        can also use any shell command to send the notifications.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Install supervisor-alert on your system:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            sudo pip install supervisor-alert
        
        Then create the file ``/etc/supervisor/conf.d/supervisor_alert.conf`` as
        root:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            [eventlistener:supervisor_alert]
            command=supervisor-alert --telegram
            events=PROCESS_STATE_RUNNING,PROCESS_STATE_EXITED,PROCESS_STATE_FATAL
            autostart=true
            autorestart=true
            user=supervisor_alert
        
        This will send the notifications over Telegram, to use something else,
        for example `ntfy <https://github.com/dschep/ntfy>`__, pass in the
        command:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            command=supervisor-alert -c 'ntfy send'
        
        This configuration will run the event listener as the user
        ``supervisor_alert``. It is a good practice to isolate services by
        running them as separate users (and avoiding running them as root). Add
        the user with:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            sudo adduser supervisor_alert --system --no-create-home
        
        Optionally, you can also subscribe to different supervisor events, `look
        at the docs <http://supervisord.org/events.html#event-types>`__ to see
        on which ones you'd like to be notified.
        
        Finally, load the config and start the event listener:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            sudo supervisorctl reread
            sudo supervisorctl update
        
        Test if it's working by restarting one of your services:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            sudo supervisorctl restart <process_name>
