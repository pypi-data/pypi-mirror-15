Description: rcluster makes launching and accessing an R cluster on AWS simple and
        accessible.
        
        This repository will:
        
        -  Create a connection to your AWS account
        -  Create a R cluster AMI saved to your AWS registry
        -  Allow you to launch a master and a stated number of worker nodes,
           automating the network connections between them and hosting a common
           NFS-based home folder under the default ``cluster`` user:
        
           -  /home/cluster is shared between master and all workers
           -  /home/cluster/hostfile contains the IPs of accessible worker nodes
              and spare master nodes, repeated based on the number of available
              worker cores
           -  ``cluster`` user's .Rprofile defines an R function
              (``defaultCluster()``) which will reference the hostfile to create
              a PSOCK-based cluster
        
        After that, login to RStudio Server as normal on the master, run
        ``defaultCluster()``, and use the returned parallel cluster object with
        ``parLapply()`` and its peers.
        
        Getting Started
        ===============
        
        First, you must create and save locally your AWS access key ID and
        secret access key
        (`instructions <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSGettingStartedGuide/AWSCredentials.html>`__).
        
        Next, run ``rcluster-config`` from your command line. Note that this
        function will, by default, write your AWS access key and secret access
        key to a hidden folder in your user directory.
        
        There are currently three functions to launch and manage an R cluster:
        
        -  ``rcluster`` - Launch an R cluster on AWS using the default
           configuration file. This function will open your default browser to
           the RStudio Server login page on the master instance.
        -  ``rcluster-open`` - Access an active R cluster (opens a new tab in
           your web browser to the RStudio Server instance, if available).
        -  ``rcluster-terminate`` - Terminate all instances associated with your
           ``rcluster`` configuration.
