        the changes are applied or none.

        To upload an OSC file it has to conform to the OsmChange specification
        with the following differences:

        Each element must carry a changeset and a version attribute, except when
        you are creating an element where the version is not required as the
        server sets that for you. The changeset must be the same as the changeset
        ID being uploaded to.
        A `<delete>` block in the OsmChange document may have an `if-unused`
        attribute (the value of which is ignored). If this attribute is present,
        then the delete operation(s) in this block are conditional and will only
        be executed if the object to be deleted is not used by another object.
        Without the if-unused, such a situation would lead to an error, and the
        whole diff upload would fail.
        OsmChange documents generally have user and uid attributes on each
        element. These are not required in the document uploaded to the API.

        **id**
