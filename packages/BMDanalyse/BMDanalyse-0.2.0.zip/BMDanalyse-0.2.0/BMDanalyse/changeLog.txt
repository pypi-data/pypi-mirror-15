
BMDanalyse 0.2.0, 2016-06-07
----------------------------
- Add setLevels to imageWin Viewbox image showing bone loss and gain. This is
  now a requirement in pyqtgraph-develop.
- Convert all images to 8-bit upon loading.
- Added MatplotlibWidget.py - This is modified from pyqtgraph to account for
  changes in more recent versions of matplotlib i.e. since matplotlib 1.4.0,
  NavigationToolbar2QTAgg no longer exists
- Add Analysis toolbox to side panel
- Restructed files. MainWindow and TableWidget classes moved to own modules
- Added ROI selection management to MultiRoiViewBox class to handle case 
  where ROIs are overlapping and the lower one could not be selected
- Update BMDanalyse software requirements. No longer support Python 2.6, but
  should still work.

BMDanalyse 0.1.3, 2013-06-06
----------------------------
- v0.1.2 and below not working in PySide as PySide does not support multiple 
  inheritence for old style classes. All BMDanalyse old style python classes 
  were modified to new style to make them compatible with PySide
- Various fixes to make compatible with PySide. This includes modifying 
  uses of QString and QStringList which are not supported by PySide (and PyQt
  API #2)
- Fix to functions loadROI and saveROI of class MultiRoiViewBox in 
  ViewBoxCustom.py. Functions getOpenFileName(s) and getSaveFileName return a 
  tuple in PySide but return a QStringList in PyQt.
  Also fix to functions loadImages and BMDtoCSVfile of class MainWindow in 
  BMDanalyse.py for the same reason.
- Fix to imageFileList (type QtGui.QListWidget()). PySide doesn't support
  function setItemSelected. Rather use setSelected function of QListWidgetItem
- Request to pyqtgraph to use orderdict from PyPi for Python 2.6. Ordered
  dictionary implemented by pyqtgraph gives errors when zooming ROIs
- Request to pyqtgraph to update to MatplotlibWidget class so that it works
  with PySide
- Change to BMDanalyse.run() to test if QApplication already exists. This was
  required to be able to reload the BMDanalyse GUI when using PySide.

BMDanalyse 0.1.2, 2013-05-23 (Not released)
-------------------------------------------
- Added support for polyline ROIs. Polyline ROIs are drawn by the user
- Added version to BMDanalyse.__init__ so it could be imported into setup.py
- Removed dependency on scipy (only signle function scipy.misc.imread() used). 
  Now use PIL instead to read image and convert it to a numpy array. 
- All icons now png image format. Previously some were Windows icon files (ico)

BMDanalyse 0.1.1, 2013-03-17
----------------------------
- Fixed bug that prevented Image Analysis Window from updating even if the user
  had changed the order of images in the main input image window
- Reset image index to zero every time Image Analysis Window is opened so first
  image is always shown
- Added QFrame with label to Image Analysis Window to identify the index of the 
  current image displayed
- Provided new sample medical images (output from pyvXRAY - soon to be released 
  on PyPi), both with and without implant
