    """Run the tests in the specified tool tests in a Galaxy instance.

    All referenced tools (by default all the tools in the current working
    directory) will be tested and the results quickly summarized.

    To run these tests planemo needs a Galaxy instance to utilize, planemo
    will search parent directories to see if any is a Galaxy instance
    - but one can pick the Galaxy instance to use with the --galaxy_root
    option or force planemo to download a disposable instance with the
    ``--install_galaxy`` flag.

    In additon to to quick summary printed to the console - various detailed
    output summaries can be configured. ``tool_test_output.html`` (settable
    via ``--test_output``) will contain a human consumable HTML report
    describing the test run. A JSON file (settable via ``--test_output_json``
    and defaulting to ``tool_test_output.json``) will also be created. These
    files can can be disabled by passing in empty arguments or globally by
    setting the values ``default_test_output`` and/or
    ``default_test_output_json`` in ``~/.planemo.yml`` to ``null``. For
    continuous integration testing a xUnit-style report can be confiured using
    the ``--test_output_xunit``.

    planemo uses temporarily generated config files and environment variables
    to attempt to shield this execution of Galaxy from manually launched runs
    against that same Galaxy root - but this may not be bullet proof yet so
    please careful and do not try this against production Galaxy instances.
