        A plugin for flake8 finding likely bugs and design problems in your
        program.  Contains warnings that don't belong in pyflakes and pep8::
        
            bug·bear  (bŭg′bâr′)
            n.
            1. A cause of fear, anxiety, or irritation: *Overcrowding is often
               a bugbear for train commuters.*
            2. A difficult or persistent problem: *"One of the major bugbears of
               traditional AI is the difficulty of programming computers to
               recognize that different but similar objects are instances of the
               same type of thing" (Jack Copeland).*
            3. A fearsome imaginary creature, especially one evoked to frighten
               children.
        
        List of warnings
        ----------------
        
        B001
        ~~~~
        
        Do not use bare ``except:``, it also catches unexpected events like
        memory errors, interrupts, system exit, and so on.  Prefer ``except
        Exception:``.  If you're sure what you're doing, be explicit and write
        ``except BaseException:``.
        
        Tests
        -----
        
        Just run::
        
            python setup.py test
        
        
        OMG, this is Python 3 only!
        ---------------------------
        
        Relax, you can run ``flake8`` with all popular plugins as a *tool*
        perfectly fine under Python 3.5+ even if you want to analyze Python 2
        code.  This way you'll be able to parse all of the new syntax supported
        on Python 3 but also *effectively all* the Python 2 syntax at the same
        time.
        
        If you're still invested in Python 2, there might be a small subset of
        deprecated syntax that you'd have to abandon... but you're already doing
        that, right?  `six <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/six>`_ or
        `python-future <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/future>`_ bridge the gaps.
        
        By making the code exclusively Python 3.5+, I'm able to focus on the
        quality of the checks and re-use all the nice features of the new
        releases (check out `pathlib <docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html>`_)
        instead of wasting cycles on Unicode compatiblity, etc.
