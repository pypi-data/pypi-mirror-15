[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/sphinxcontrib-pyexec/badge/?version=latest)](http://sphinxcontrib-pyexec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/3ptscience/sphinxcontrib-pyexec.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/3ptscience/sphinxcontrib-pyexec)


A sphinx extension for running python code and displaying both the input and
output [sphinx documentation](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/). 

In the conf.py add `PyExec` to your extensions.

In the ReStructuredText file, use the `exec` environment

```
  .. exec::
    print 2 + 2
```

To output python code & the results in your documentation. 

```
  >> print 2 + 2
  4
```

Note that you need to include the `print` statement for the output to be shown. To see it in action, checkout the [Properties documentation](http://propertiespy.readthedocs.io/).
