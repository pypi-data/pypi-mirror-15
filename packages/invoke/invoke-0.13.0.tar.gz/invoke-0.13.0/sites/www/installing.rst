Installing

Basic installation
==================

The recommended way to get Invoke is to **install the latest stable release**
via `pip <http://pip-installer.org>`_::

    $ pip install invoke

We currently support **Python 2.6/2.7** and **Python 3.3+**. Users still on
Python 2.5 or older are urged to upgrade.

As long as you have a supported Python interpreter, **there are no other
dependencies**.  Invoke is pure-Python, and contains copies of its few
dependencies within its source tree.

.. note:: 
    See `this blog post
    <http://bitprophet.org/blog/2012/06/07/on-vendorizing/>`_ for background on
    our decision to vendorize dependencies.

Getting the development version (without source control)
========================================================

Users who don't intend to actively develop, but who still want to obtain the
in-development version (to help test new features or to cope with any
unfortunate lapses in release schedule) can still use ``pip``, but should give
the ``==dev`` "version" explicitly::

    $ pip install invoke==dev

.. seealso::
    :doc:`development` for details on full source control checkouts.
