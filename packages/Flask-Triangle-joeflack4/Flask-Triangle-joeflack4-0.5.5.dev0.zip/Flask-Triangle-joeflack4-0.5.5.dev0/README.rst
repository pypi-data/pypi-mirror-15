**With great UX comes great security needs.** *Uncle Ben*

Flask-Triangle is utterly influenced by Flask-WTF_. It aims to provide you with
similar features : form input handling and validation. The main difference is
that Flask-Triangle is designed with AngularJS_ and XHR in mind.

Flask-Triangle comes preloaded with various features :

    * End-to-end data validation based on JSONschema_.
    * A collection of ready to use *Widgets* for both standard HTML inputs and
      toolkits (i.e. UI-Bootstrap_).
    * A set of *Modifiers* to adapt the default behaviour to your needs.
    * Various tools to integrate AngularJS in your Flask_ application.

For detailed informations, have a look at the documentation_.
