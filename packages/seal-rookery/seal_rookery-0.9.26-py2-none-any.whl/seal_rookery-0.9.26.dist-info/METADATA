Description: Welcome to the Court Seal Rookery
        =================================
        
        This is a collection of court seals that can be cloned and used in any
        project. Original files can be found in the ``orig`` directory and
        converted versions can be found in the numerical directories.
        
        The goal of this project is to collect and maintain an updated
        repository of all the seals that courts have created and to create seals
        for those rare courts that lack them altogether.
        
        Contributing
        ------------
        
        This project is blissfully easy to contribute to and we need lots of
        help gathering or making files. The process for this is pretty simple.
        
        1. Find or make the image and ensure it follows our quality guidelines
           (below).
        2. Add the image file to the ``orig`` directory.
        3. Edit ``seals.json`` to include the relevant fields for your new file.
        
        That's it!
        
        index.html is a tool for quickly being able to see the progress on
        obtaining seals and quickly check the quality of the seals that have
        been obtained. You can refresh this file by opening it and pasting in
        the contents of seals.json where indicated (sloppy but effective).
        
        If you wish to get involved as a developer, you'll want to install this
        repository from git. Do the following:
        
        1. Install imagemagick:
        
           ::
        
               sudo apt-get install imagemagick
        
        2. Download and link up the code:
        
           ::
        
               sudo git clone https://github.com/freelawproject/seal-rookery /usr/local/seal_rookery
               sudo ln -s `pwd`/seal_rookery `python -c "from distutils.sysconfig import get_python_lib; print get_python_lib()"`/seal_rookery
        
        3. Install from your local source:
        
           ::
        
               python setup.py install
        
        4. Update the local copies of the images:
        
           ::
        
               update-seals
        
        Installation for Non-Developers
        -------------------------------
        
        Basic usage doesn't require any installation, but if you wish to import
        the ``seals.json`` file into a Python program, you may want to install
        the Seal Rookery as a Python module in your system. To do so:
        
        1. Install imagemagick
        
           ::
        
               sudo apt-get install imagemagick
        
        2. Install the seal rookery
        
           ::
        
               pip install seal_rookery
        
        3. Update the seals
        
           ::
        
               update-seals
        
        You can then import the ``seals.json`` information into your project
        using:
        
        ::
        
            from seal_rookery import seals_data
        
        And you will have various sizes of all the seals ready to go on your
        system.
        
        Quality Guidelines
        ------------------
        
        Fact is, images are hard to work with and courts don't always do the
        best job. Follow these guidelines so we can have nice things:
        
        1. Convert your original file to ``png`` or ``svg``, as appropriate. If
           you have the ``ps`` file, include that as well.
        2. If you use transparency or the file has it, make sure the file looks
           OK on a background other than white. If it looks bizarre on an orange
           or blue background, fix it by adding a white layer on the bottom.
        3. Trim any extraneous margins and if the seal is circular, make the
           corners transparent.
        4. If the item was previously a ``jpeg`` or ``gif``, it's good to clean
           up the splotchiness created by the ``jpeg`` compression. You'll see
           it if you zoom in.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        We know of no instances where courts have requested a take down of their
        seal, however usage of government seals has caused a
        `few <https://www.publicknowledge.org/news-blog/blogs/nsa-spying-fine-trademark-infringement-crosse>`_
        `stirs <http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/03/us/03fbi.html>`_ in the past.
        Don't attempt to represent the government or its agents.
        
        Deployment
        ----------
        
        1. Update the version info in setup.py.
        
        2. Install the requirements in requirements-dev.txt
        
        3. Set up a config file at ~/.pypirc containing the upload locations and
           authentication credentials.
        
        4. Generate a distribution:
        
           ::
        
               python setup.py bdist_wheel
        
        5. Upload the distribution:
        
           ::
        
               twine upload dist/* -r pypi
        
        Copyright
        ---------
        
        Two things. First, if you are creating original work, please consider
        signing and emailing a contributor license to us so that we may protect
        the work later, if needed. We do this because we have a lot of
        experience with IP litigation, and this is a good way to protect a
        project.
        
        Second, if you're just curious about the copyright of this repository,
        see the License file for details. The short version of this is you can
        pretty much use it however you desire.
