ztv Change Log
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

--------------------
0.2.3-4   2016-06-21
--------------------

- updated shift-key behavior in slice plot mode on primary image panel when releasing button to avoid having the selected slice 'jump'
- bug fixes
- fixed MAJOR bug of a memory leak related to matplotlib; ztv hadn't been properly calling cla() to clear axes and thus matplotlib objects were just piling up in memory.  (There may be some remaining similar leaks to be fixed, but the vast majority of the culprit was the imshow()'s and those are now fixed.)

--------------------
0.2.3-3   2016-06-10
--------------------

- implemented cursor readout in plot_panel
- implemented shift-key for locking to horizontal/vertical plot slices on primary image panel
- fixed some logic in cursor modes when entering/exiting primary image panel with button pressed

--------------------
0.2.3-2   2016-05-31
--------------------

- added viridis colormap
- couple of API bug fixes (thanks samverstocken!)

--------------------
0.2.3-1   2016-03-20
--------------------

- fixed bug that wx timestamps were sometimes large negative unchanging integers, which killed click-and-drag zooming

------------------
0.2.3   2016-03-18
------------------

- release with accumulated bug fixes etc.

----------------------
0.2.3dev5   2016-03-11
----------------------

- upgraded min/max/robust-stat calcs to better ignore NaN/Inf in displayed images & stats-box/photometry calculations
- changed colors of curview_rectangle in OverviewImagePanel and zoom_rect in PrimaryImagePanel to match and be orange, which in tests looks better than the old dark green (overview) and magenta (primary) and makes more sense to have be matching
- reduced initial delay in CommandListenerThread to 10 seconds (had been 1 minute) to reduce potential confusion about zombie ztv windows
- fixed a matplotlib warning bug annoyance - problem was __about__.py imports one routine from astropy_helpers, but astropy_helpers has some (unrelated/unnecessary for our purposes) matplotlib code.  Fix was to include the astropy_helpers.git_helpers code directly within ztv, to avoid both the annoyance warnings, but also blocking pylab.show() from working correctly at times in the underlying python session.
- re-factored phot_panel, plot_panel, stats_panel almost entirely out of ztv.py main module for clarity/maintainability reasons.  (ztv main module still has few hooks into stats_panel regarding doing auto clim setting from stats box, but that seems acceptable at this stage)
- fixed recently introduced bug that was causing accelerator key strokes to fail in primary_image_panel

--------------------
0.2.2-1   2016-03-08
--------------------

- cleaned up release of current codebase incorporating lots of bugfixes from recent months.

----------------------
0.2.2dev2   2015-12-27
----------------------

- fixed bug in overview image panel where non-square images weren't being displayed correctly

----------------------
0.2.2dev1   2015-12-27
----------------------

- first steps toward refactoring out cursor code relating to specific control panels from main ztv code

--------------------
0.2.1-9   2015-11-25
--------------------

- pypandoc hadn't been installed when released -8, so had to re-do

--------------------
0.2.1-8   2015-11-25
--------------------

- updated fits_faker_panel to work with wxpython v3
- fixed bug in ztv_api that was causing crashes when using control_panel_module_path keyword (used by fits_faker_panel example)

--------------------
0.2.1-7   2015-11-03
--------------------

- emergency bug fix

--------------------
0.2.1-6   2015-11-03
--------------------

- Made default datadir and auto-load pattern be the current working directory (rather than just user's home dir)
- dev2:  made temporary fix to ztv.set_clim to force image redisplay even when cim unchanged.  Problem was that new images weren't being displayed automatically for a fixed clim.  (Need to come back and re-evaluate how images are loaded and look for remaining inefficiencies, e.g. code called more than once during a single image load)
- dev3:  speed improvements in areas that will help speed of auto-loading new images; primarily reducing number of extraneous recalculations of aperture photometry
- dev4:  speed improvements in areas that will help speed of auto-loading new images; primarily reducing number of times that redraw_*_image routines are called
- dev5:  reduce number of times that image normalization is recalculated by caching; modified some syntaxes for easier future upkeep.  
- dev6:  moved rebinning of overview image (really sub-sampling, not rebinning) from allowing matplotlib to do implicitly to doing explicitly before passing to matplotlib.  This speeds things up a lot (0.3sec on a ~2014 MacBook Pro Retina) for large (2K) images.

--------------------
0.2.1-5   2015-09-22
--------------------

- added a delay to WatchMasterPIDThread before beginning watch loop

--------------------
0.2.1-3   2015-09-08
--------------------

- updated README.md for anaconda install example

--------------------
0.2.1-2   2015-09-08
--------------------

- added instructions for install on a fresh OS X Yosemite 10.10 system using Homebrew Python distribution to README.md
- added instructions for install on a fresh OS X Yosemite 10.10 system using Anaconda Python distribution to README.md
- in ztv_api.py: for launching ztv in a separate python process, made `pythonw` the default python executable, reverting to `python` only if `pythonw` is not available.  This gets around some of the Frameworks/wxPython issues that crop up when running in a virtual environment, particularly, e.g., anaconda python distro.

------------------
0.2.1-1
------------------

- fixed __init__.py so that "import ztv ; print ztv.__version__" works

------------------
v0.2.1, 0.2.0
------------------

- now requiring wxPython version >= 3.0.0  (This is the reason for the larger bump in version number)
- fixed a number of GUI bugs that wxPython upgrade introduced. (More likely than bugs with wxPython 3 is that the wxPython 2 had bugs that had been worked-around and/or other issues.)
- added instructions for install on a fresh OS X Yosemite 10.10 system using system's Python distribution to README.md
- (No difference between v0.2.0 and v0.2.1 in git repository, except that had messed up uploading to pypi & couldn't rewrite the same filename, so had to increment version number to fix formatting of README.md on pypi webpage.  Issue was pypandoc install was broken first time I built.)

------------------
v0.1.3dev
------------------

2015-07-29:
- implemented that z-key on primary image activates a plot in z-dim of image stack in plot_panel 
- FITS header is updated in fits header window when a new file is loaded (or header for sky file or header for flat file)
- misc bug fixes

pre-2015-07-29:
- updated version number b/c realized had already released 0.1.2
- fixed bug in plot_panel where doing slice beyond image size caused warnings.
- implemented click-and-drag to aperture radii on profile plot in phot_panel

------------------
v0.1.2, 2015-04-22
------------------

- updated version number b/c had already released 0.1.1dev 

------------------
v0.1.0post2, 2015-04-22
------------------

- added default_data_dir, and default_autoload-pattern options
- changed default color of lines to be more visible against gist-heat map
- added auto-stats-box option for scaling on load of new image
- Fix bug in reading fits files that was a problem in autoloading when fits file hadn't yet been written fully to disk.

------------------
v0.1.0post1, 2015-04-22
------------------

- Fixed several bugs for use on linux/ubuntu

------------------
