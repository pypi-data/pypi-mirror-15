Description: # pyscheduler
        Task Scheduler
        
        Create scheduled tasks at runtime easily.
        
        # Installation
        
        ```bash
        pip install python-scheduler
        ```
        
        # Example
        
        ```bash
        from pyscheduler import schedule
        
        # crawl_task runs in every 2 minutes
        @schedule('*/2 * * * *')
        def crawl_task():
            print 'crawl task'
        
        ```
        
        # Important
        
        It won't definitely create any cronjob on the os level. All tasks will be executed on runtime.
        
        Every cron syntax can be used.
