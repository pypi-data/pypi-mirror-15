cloudflare-python / python-cloudflare
=====================================

Installation
------------

.. code:: bash

        $ sudo pip install cloudflare-python python-cloudflare

Yes - that simple! (the sudo may not be needed in some cases).

All this does is install the cloudflare package as a dependency
