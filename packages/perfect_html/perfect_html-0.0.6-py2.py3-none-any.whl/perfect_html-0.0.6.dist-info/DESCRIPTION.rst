Perfect HTML
=======================

Tired of running auto indent? Tired of running shitty html parsers and formatters?  
Well hopefully this will cure your ailments.

This package when installed will allow you to autoformat any .html files in a directory
specified.  No frills just pretty formatting.  This leverages BeautifulSoup 4 for the formatting
library.  I'm just writing the wrapper.
