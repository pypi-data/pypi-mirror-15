Description: 
         PyRIC is Linux wireless network interface card library. It provides the ability to
         manipuate, identify and enumerate your system's wireless cards. PyRIC is a pure
         python port of a subset of the functionality provided by iw, ifconfig, iwconfig
         and rfkill.
        
         PyRIC is:
         * Pythonic: No ctypes, SWIG etc. PyRIC redefines C header files as Python and
         uses sockets to communicate with kernel.
         * Self-sufficient: No third-party files used, PyRIC is completely self-contained
         * Fast: (relatively speaking) PyRIC is faster than using iw through subprocess.Popen
         * Parseless: Get the output you without parsing output from iw. Never worry about
         iw updates and rewriting your parsers.
         * Easy: If you can use iw, you can use PyRIC
