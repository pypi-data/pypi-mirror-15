  1) overall
   o make a cli as well
   o determine if rfkill issue is related only to ubuntu
  2) libnl.py
   o see (1) in RFI
  4) pyw
   o look at iw dev wlan0 link - has information about the AP connected to
   o add txget from iw i.e. netlink perspective
   o find a better way to find the supported standards of a card
   o for now, using ioctl to set ip addresses
    - move to netlink (using ip ?) or is better to keep as ioctl since this
     allows us to set erroneous values for netmask, broadcast whereas ip forces
     validity
   o Can we find the current channel of a radio in monitor mode that is actively
     scanning?
   o parse NL80211_ATTR_WIPHY_BANDS (have workaround currently in place)
