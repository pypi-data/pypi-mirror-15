1) add a cli
2) rfkill - unblocks/blocks all devices (as does the cli rfkill) Is this an
  an ubuntu, kernel or overall issue
3) parse NL80211_ATTR_WIPHY_BANDS (have workaround currently in place)
 - after figuring out _CIPHER_SUITES, may be able to get a solution for the bands
6) find a better way to get supported standards of a card
8) Two commands that would add information of minor value
 o ethtool. uses ioctl but does not follow same pattern as ifconfig seems
    to use
  - ethtool -i <dev> gives driver information including firmware-version
  - ethtool -S <dev> gives some statistics on rx/tx
 o iw dev wlan0 link returns information related to associated station. It sends
   two commands the first is to initiate a scan, the second is @NL80211_CMD_GET_STATION.
   The return from the kernel is a @NL80211_CMD_NEW_STATION, one of the attributes
   is a @NL80211_ATTR_STA_INFO
  - What is this? Looking at nl80211_h line 1648 we find the definition for
    NL80211_STA_INFO - this has to be the corresponding data. Doesn't work, there
    is something I'm missing but cannot figure out
  - iw requests info on the BSSID, can we request the info on any STA?
  - Line 1806 These attribute types are used with %NL80211_ATTR_STA_INFO
    when getting information about a station.
 11) tried NL80211_CMD_GET_WIPHY, setting _WIPHY_TX_POWER_LEVEL but did
  not return the current power level - currently cannot find anything in nl80211.h
  that could be used to get tx power
 14) look at udevadm info --query=all --path /sys/class/net/<dev>
  o has devie driver, name and some other details but appears to get these
   the same way PyRIC does
 17) distro tests
  o openSUSE
  o RedHat/Fedora
  o Debian (g2g)
  o Arch
  o CentOs (?)
  o slackware
  o dd-wrt/OpenWRT
 18) port structs from new nl80211.h
 19) iw is showing a command that doesn't exist
 21) look at NL80211_CMD_START_AP - no need to try and recreate the wheel by
  replicate hostap but could be useful
 22) txset
   o NOTE: the following is consistent with what iw gives us
   o when using dBm
    - get Operation not supported for setting tx power (see pyw.txset)
    - have tried using the ifindex and phy. Both methods are accepted, returning
     only Errno 95.
   o when using mBm
    - no errors reported but tx power is not changed
   o Is the operation not supported by my cards? or is it not supported by the
     kernel?
 23) Unknown Command 104. After updating to kernel 4, iw phy <phy> info returns
  a Unknown command (104). pyw.phyinfo does not return this.
   - iw 3.17 being used
   - command 104 is NL80211_CMD_SET_QOS_MAP
   - iw->util.c:
   const char *command_name(enum nl80211_commands cmd)
   {
	if (cmd <= NL80211_CMD_MAX && commands[cmd])
		return commands[cmd];
	sprintf(cmdbuf, "Unknown command (%d)", cmd);
	return cmdbuf;
   }

   iw's nl80211.h defines NL80211_CMD_SET_QOS_MAP but util.c does not specify
   this command in commands which explains the unknown command.
   - I've gone through the stream returned from the kernel for a wiphy request
   and pyw is not getting this command
   - It does not look like iw is hardcoding this but I cannot see any other way.
   - If this command was being returned, pyw would correctly identify it as
    NL80211_CMD_SET_QOS_MAP - need to identify a card that supports this command
    and determine that pyw does correctly identify it
  24) confirm download_url in setup.py is valid
