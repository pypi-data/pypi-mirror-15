Defines the Pyric error class and constants for some errors. All pyric errors
will follow the 2-tuple form of EnvironmentError

Requires:
 linux (preferred 3.x kernel)
 Python 2.7
 
 pyric 0.0.2
  desc: wireless nic (radio) manipulation, enumeration, and attribute enumeration
 includes:  /net /lib pyw 0.0.3 radio 0.0.4 utils 0.0.2
 changes:
  o added ifconfig/iwconfig functions to pyw
  o reworked exception handling
   - all exceptions from libnl, libio & pyw are pyric.error
   - pyw will allow pyric to pass through
   - reworked errorcodes to derive from errno
  o added _iostub_, _nlstub_ and reworked traditiona commands to utilize these
  o finished porting nl80211_h and nl80211_c (for attribute policies)
  o pyw no longer provides familyid as a public function, rather it now uses a
    private global value for the nl80211 family id and will instantiate it one
    time only. In this way, callers do not not have to worry about retrieving and
    passing it
  o regdom get & set implemented
  o info implemented

 pyric 0.0.3
  desc: wireless nic (radio) manipulation, enumeration, and attribute enumeration
 includes:  /net /lib pyw 0.0.3 device 0.0.3 channels 0.0.1
 changes:
  o removed radio/Radio class (shouldn't be the responsibility of this)
  o added channels.py (provides channel/freq functions)
  o added RFI page for notes/observations/questions
  o changed utils.py to device.py
  o updated libnl
  o added channel set & get
   - channel get only works when device is associated
   - channel set only works when card is in monitor mode and all other interfaces
    have been deleted
  o added device add & delete

 pyric 0.0.4
  desc: wireless nic (radio) manipulation, enumeration, and attribute enumeration
  includes:  /net /lib pyw 0.1.0 device 0.0.3 channels 0.0.1 setup 0.0.2
  changes:
   o rewrote pyw function to handle one-time & persistent functions using a
    single function interface for each command

 pyric 0.0.5
  desc: wireless nic (radio) manipulation, enumeration, and attribute enumeration
  includes:  /net /lib /docs pyw 0.1.2 device 0.0.3 channels 0.0.1
  changes:
   o added Card class and wrote functions to handle it in pyw
   o implemented basic help functionality (for nl80211)
   o added monitor flag(s) support in devadd
   o began work on a user guide
   o added nested attribute handling
   o added partial phyinfo handles all but supported channels/bands
   o fixed bugs in devinfo and phyinfo
   o added setup.py and required files

 pyric 0.0.6
  desc: Pythonic iw - wireless nic (radio) manipulation, enumeration, and attribute
  enumeration
  includes:  /docs /examples /lib /net pyw 0.1.2 device 0.0.3 channels 0.0.1
  changes:
   o move pyric under pyric to facilitate setuptools and packaging
    - moved LICENSE, MANIFEST.in README.md setup.cfg setup.py examples/ PyRIC.pdf
      to outer pyric
   o at least one card (ath9k_htc) has an unknown supported command, added a
    wrapper around the list IFTYPES to handle commands not listed

 pyric 0.0.7
  desc: Pythonic iw - wireless nic (radio) manipulation, enumeration, and attribute
  enumeration
  includes:  /docs /examples /lib /net pyw 0.1.2 device 0.0.3 channels 0.0.1
  changes:
   o libnl: attribute related i.e. nla_* moved out of GENLMsg class and made as
     standalone functions
   o in pyw
    - added modeset/modeget in pyw
    - readded freqset in pyw
    - added devcmds in pyw
    - annotated (in comments) if fcts needed root privileges
    - added functions to get/set ip address, netmask and broadcast
    - fixed PEP8 errors
    - added function pulling supported freqs out NL80211_ATTR_WIPHY_BANDS
     * ATT using _getfreqs_ which attempts to find the packed version of every
      freq
     * nl80211_c.nl80211_parse_freqs works but is slower than _getfreqs_ and
      uses several hacks which may make it invalid for certain cards
    - added 4.9GHz frequencies to channels.py
    - fixed _validmac_ to validate both uppercase & lowercase hex characters
    - added devfreqs, devchs
   o unittest completed 61 tests ran in 5.360s
   o added rfkill (still working on it)

 pyric 0.1.0
  desc: Pythonic iw - wireless nic (radio) manipulation, enumeration, and attribute
  enumeration
  includes:  /docs /examples /lib /net pyw 0.1.2 device 0.0.3 channels 0.0.1
  changes:
   o production release

 pyric 0.1.1 t0 0.1.1-*
  desc: wireless nic library: wireless radio identification, manipulation, enumeration
  includes:  /nlhelp /lib /net /utils pyw 0.1.2
  changes:
   o restructured hierarchy
    - renamed device to hardware
   o added mac address related functions to hardware
   o split rfkill into functions file and definition file
   o added block/unblock to pyw
   o updated pyw to handle the newest version of libnl.py's processing of nested
     attributes

 pyric 0.1.2
  desc: wireless nic library: wireless radio identification, manipulation, enumeration
  includes: /nlhelp /lib /net /utils pyw 0.1.4
  changes:
   o fixed install issues via pip where data files were not being loaded onto
    the user's system
   o identified and fixed error with ouifetch with invalid path of default oui file
   o moved parseoui from hardware to ouifetch renaming to parse
   o removed ouifetch execution ability - parse and fetch must be called w/in
    python console. Will eventually add this capability as as top-level program
