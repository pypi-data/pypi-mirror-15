        Quickstart
        ----------
        
        Most users will only need to run as a command-line tool with a ped and VCF, e.g:
        
        ```
        python -m peddy --plot --prefix ceph-1463 ceph1463.vcf.gz ceph1463.ped
        ```
        
        This create **ceph-1463.html** which you can open in any browser to
        interactively explore your data.
        
        It will also create create 3 csv files and 3 QC plots.
        These will indicate:
        
        + discrepancies between ped-reported and genotype-inferred relations
        + discrepancies between ped-reported and genotype-inferred sex
        + higher levels of HET calls or more variance in ref / (ref + alt read) for het calls.
        
        Finally, it will create a new file ped files `ceph1463.peddy.ped` that also lists
        the most useful columns from the `het-check` and `sex-check`. Users can **first
        look at this extended ped file for an overview of likely problems** and then refer
        to the plots and .csv files for more detailed information.
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        
        **NOTE** this module used to be named to "pedagree".
        
        `peddy` is a python library for querying, QC'ing, and manipulating pedigree files.
        
        It currently makes it simple to extract things like:
        
         + parent-child pairs
         + trios
         + sibs
         + stats on number of males/females/trios/affecteds/unaffecteds
         + families.
         + families with at least N members
         + families with at least N children
         + [not yet] families with at least N generations
         + coefficient of relatedness given relation defined in the pedigree.
        
        Also, given a pedigree file and a VCF file peddy provides tools to:
        
         + find likely sample mixups (or PED errors)
           - sex mixups on X-Chrom
           - family mixups by inferring relatedness with VCF
        
         + find mendelian errors
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        ```Python
        >>> from peddy import Ped, SEX, PHENOTYPE
        
        >>> p = Ped('my.ped')
        # not yet.
        #>>> p.dot() # draw the pedigree with graphviz
        
        # not yet
        # find any obvious issues (3 parents, mom as male, etc).
        >>> p.validate()
        
        # number of affecteds, un, males, females, etc. (contingency table?)
        >>> p.summary()
        
        # iterable
        >>> p.samples()
        
        >>> p.samples(phenotype=PHENOTYPE.AFFECTED, sex=SEX.MALE)
        
        # sample object
        >>> s = next(p.samples())
        
        >>> s.phenotype
        
        >>> s.sex
        
        >>> s.mom
        
        >>> s.dad
        
        >>> s.siblings
        
        >>> s.kids
        ```
        
        Quality Control
        ---------------
        
        If cyvcf2 is installed, then, given a ped-file and a VCF, we can look for cases where the relationships
        defined in the ped file do not match the relationships derived from the genotypes in the VCF.
        
        ```Python
        >>> from peddy import Ped
        >>> p = Ped('cohort.ped')
        >>> df = p.ped_check('cohort.vcf.gz')
        >>> df[df.error] # show pairs of samples where the inferred differs from the reported.
        
        ```
        
        [![relplot](http://peddy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/_images/ped-check.png)](http://github.com/brentp/cyvcf2/)
        
        We don't see any obvious errors in this pedigree. An obvious error would be when a red colored dot clusters with blue dots. 
        The *outlined dots* have a very low IBS0 rate, indicating that they are likely parent-child pairs.
        
        By looking for the frequency of heterozygotes in the non-PAR regions of
        the X chromosome, we can determine sex from a VCF:
        
        ```Python
        >>> from peddy import Ped
        >>> p = Ped('cohort.ped')
        >>> p.sex_check('cohort.vcf.gz', plot=True)
        ... List of all samples with number of HETs, HOMREF, HOMALT on X
        ```
        This will also create an image like this one where we can
        see a clear sample mixup.

        On creating a pedigree object (via Ped('some.ped'). `peddy` will print warnings to STDERR as appropriate like:
        
        ```
        pedigree warning: '101811-101811' is dad but has female sex
        pedigree warning: '101897-101897' is dad but has female sex
        pedigree warning: '101896-101896' is mom of self
        pedigree warning: '102110-102110' is mom but has male sex
        pedigree warning: '102110-102110' is mom of self
        pedigree warning: '101381-101381' is dad but has female sex
        pedigree warning: '101393-101393' is mom but has male sex
        
        unknown sample: 102498-102498 in family: K34175
        unknown sample: 11509-11509 in family: K567331
        unknown sample: 5180-5180 in family: K8565
        ```
