Description: AskSO - StackOverflow Python Question Assistant
        -----------------------------------------------
        
        This is a tool to help you construct a good question about Python on
        `StackOverflow <http://stackoverflow.com/>`__, although it can help with
        other forums too. It assumes that you've written some code that isn't
        behaving correctly. This should not be a problem, as StackOverflow
        generally expects you to show that you've tried something.
        
        To install: run ``pip install ask-so`` in a terminal. You will need
        ``pip``, which you can install with the instructions
        `here <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`__.
        
        To use the tool: run ``askso`` in a terminal. If that doesn't work:
        ``python -m askso``. This will start a server. Next, visit
        http://localhost:5000/ in your browser.
