Description: About
        =====
        
        Helium_ is an integrated platform of smart sensors, communication, edge
        and cloud compute that enables numerous sensing applications.
        
        This package makes it easy to talk to the Helium API_. It offers:
        
        * A command line interface to interact with the various Helium
          endpoints
        * A service API that shows how to communicate with the Helium API and
          interpret the results.
