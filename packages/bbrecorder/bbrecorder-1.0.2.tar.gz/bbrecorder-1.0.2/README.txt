What is it?
-----------

A simple module providing a logging handler to manage caching of last N log records
until they are needed â€” and then generate them using standard common Python logging
handlers.

Installation
------------

Unless someone built a package for your OS distro, the simplest procedure
is to use ``pip`` to install the module:

    pip install bbrecorder

If you have no admin access to install things on you computer, you may install
a virtualenv and run pip inside this virtual env, or you can do a local user
installation:

    pip install --user bbrecorder
