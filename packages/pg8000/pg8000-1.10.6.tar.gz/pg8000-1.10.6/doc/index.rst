  pg8000
##########

pg8000 is a `DB-API 2.0 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/>`_ compatible
pure-Python interface to the `PostgreSQL <http://www.postgresql.org/>`_
database engine. It is one of many PostgreSQL interfaces for the Python
programming language. pg8000 is somewhat distinctive in that it is written
entirely in Python and does not rely on any external libraries (such as a
compiled python module, or PostgreSQL's libpq library).

pg8000's name comes from the belief that it is probably about the 8000th
PostgreSQL interface for Python. pg8000 is distributed under the terms of the 
BSD 3-clause license.

If you're a user of pg8000 we'd love to hear who you are and what you or your
organization is using pg8000 for. Just log an issue on GitHub or post a message
to the forum. The idea is to put together a page of users.
